title: "The New Science of Cities - GEO4-3632"
author: "Pierre-Alexandre Balland"
---

### Course description  
The new science of cities uses recent advances in network thinking, complexity science and big data management to understand how cities function, grow, and change. Beyond buildings and urban landscapes, the soul of a city is defined by a complex web of social interactions that are fueled by urban diversity and urban density. These interactions foster new inventions, social change, and wealth creation. In this course, we discuss how a complexity perspective can help us to analyze these interactions and re-think key issues in economic and urban geography. More specifically, it will introduce concepts and methods to map and measure relationships and flows between people, firms, cities, or any other element of a complex spatial system. The class is composed of lectures, interactive seminars, and group meetings.     

### What you will learn   
1. What a complexity-based paradigm is, and how it can be applied to cities
2. How to identify, describe, and analyze the economic and social structure of cities
3. How the structure of cities influence their growth and quality of life
4. General underlying patterns common to all cities
5. How the new science of cities can be used to plan smart cities   

### Seminars  
Students will actively prepare weekly tutorials in order to perform a truly interactive seminar. The idea is to use the concept and tools introduced by the lecturer to re-think (or solve) a real-world urban problem. I encourage you to think big and break the rules. Creativity is rewarded in this class.  

### Meet the instructors  
[Pierre-Alexandre Balland](https://www.paballand.com/) - p.balland@uu.nl  
[Ron Boschma](ron) - R.A.Boschma@uu.nl  
[Bas Spierings](bas) - b.spierings@uu.nl  

### Grading   
The overall grade for the class is based on an individual research paper (100% of the grade).   

### Research paper    
The research paper can be very academic, or very applied. Each student will focus on a specific urban issue and discuss the extent and the causes of this issues (academic) or how to solve this problem (applied) using a new science of cities perspective (network thinking and complexity science). The preliminary idea will be presented and discussed in individual meetings. The paper should be 1,500-word long maximum (excluding references) and contain graphics. The deadline to send the report is November 8. You need to upload your report to this [folder](https://www.dropbox.com/request/hXL2S2PnNd9oBslpjKmE) (please do not send the report by email) as a PDF.   

### Readings  
There is no class reader. The weekly readings are provided on this web-page and slides/videos will be regularly uploaded here. All articles listed should be considered mandatory reading. Additional online materials might be assigned throughout the quarter.
