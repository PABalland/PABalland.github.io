### Course description     
Economic complexity has emerged as a powerful paradigm to understand key issues in economics, geography, innovation studies, and other social sciences. Owing its popularity, in part, to its cross-disciplinary reach, the concept has shed new light on the variation in standards of living across nations (Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009), differences in sophistication of technologies (Fleming and Sorenson, 2001), and the heterogeneous distribution of knowledge in space (Balland and Rigby, 2017). This excitement is not limited to academia. A host of policy institutions, ranging from international organizations such as the World Bank, World Economic Forum, European Commission, and OECD to national and local actors, have embedded both the methodology and conceptual framework of complexity into their core toolbox. Hence, as economic complexity moves from the periphery to the core of economic thinking and development policy, this class will equip students with the key concepts and tools of economic complexity.       

### Lecture 1: Economic complexity and the wealth of nations   
**Time**: Monday, Nov. 2 [14:15-18:00] **OR** Monday, Nov. 9 [14:15-18:00]

If your campus card has an even number (i.e. the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8) then you will have class on Monday 2/11. If your campus card has odd number (i.e. the last digit is 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9) then you will have class on Monday 9/11.
