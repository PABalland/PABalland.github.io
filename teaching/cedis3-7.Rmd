#### Training proposal    
#### by [Pierre-Alexandre Balland](https://www.paballand.com) & Ron Boschma    

### Objectives        
The objective of this module is to provide participants with advanced network-based concepts and complexity tools to successfully implement a smart specialization strategy via the principle of relatedness & product space analysis. The product space is a generic term and the metrics taught in this module can be applied to the skill, occupation, scientific, technology space and other relevant networks for the implementation of a smart specialization strategy.      

### Structure  
The training consists of lectures combined with computer exercises and is open to participants with no prior knowledge of complexity thinking & metrics or programming techniques. Participants are expected to bring their laptop for the computer lab.
