#### Training proposal     
#### by [Pierre-Alexandre Balland](https://www.paballand.com) & Ron Boschma    

### Objectives         
The objective of this module is to provide participants with advanced network-based concepts and complexity tools to successfully implement a smart specialization strategy via the principle of relatedness & product space analysis. The product space is a generic term and the metrics taught in this module can be applied to the skill, occupation, scientific, technology space and other relevant networks for the implementation of a smart specialization strategy.      

### Structure   
The training consists of lectures combined with computer exercises and is open to participants with no prior knowledge of complexity thinking & metrics or programming techniques. Participants are expected to bring their laptop for the computer lab.        
  
### Day 1: Introduction to network thinking      

*Key concepts & objectives*    
- From attribute-based to network thinking   
- Networks in natural sciences, social sciences, business   
- Network thinking for policy and the S3    

*Lab 1* 
- Basic matrix algebra   
- Network data management in R         
- Creating an igraph object (in R)   

### Day 2: Centrality & relatedness from 2-mode networks          

*Key concepts & objectives*    
- Introduction to graph theory   
- Global structural indicators      
- Degree, betweenend, closeness and eigenvector centrality      

*Lab 2* 
- Structural analysis of global networks   
- Computing different forms of centrality    
- Mastering the igraph R package   

### Day 3: Relatedness metrics & relatedness density         

*Key concepts & objectives*     
- 

### Day 4: Graph visualization
