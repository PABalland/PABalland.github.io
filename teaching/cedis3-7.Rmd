#### Training proposal     
#### by [Pierre-Alexandre Balland](https://www.paballand.com) & Ron Boschma    

### Objectives         
The objective of this module is to provide participants with advanced network-based concepts and complexity tools to successfully implement a smart specialization strategy. The training consists of lectures combined with computer exercises and is intended for participants with basic knowledge of social network analysis. Participants are expected to bring their laptop for the computer lab.         

### Structure   
The training consists of lectures (morning) combined with tutorials (afternoon) and is open to  participants with no prior knowledge of complexity thinking & metrics, economic geography or programming techniques. During the afternoon, participants are expected to apply the morning prinicples to concrete problems and present their approach.  

### Day 1: What is smart specialization really about?     

*Key concepts & objectives*    
- Why developing new specializations matter           
- Regional diversification, growth & resilience       
- The EU S3 policy: critical assessment, evolution & related initiatives around the world     

### Day 2: The principle of relatedness      

*Key concepts & objectives*     
- How do regions diversify over time      
- A unifying framework for regional development 
- Relatedness & Artificial Intelligence    

### Day 3: Economic complexity indicators     

*Key concepts & objectives*     
- What is economic complexity?        
- Economic complexity, growth & inequality       
- The challenges of measuring economic complexity (high-level)     

### Day 4: A framework for smart specialization        

*Key concepts & objectives*    
- Bringing together relatedness and economic complexity index  
- A powerful framework to prioritize investments   
- Overview of potential dataset    

### Day 5: Beyond relatedness & complexity          

*Key concepts & objectives*       
- Diversification & regional resilience      
- Thriving during the twin transition      
- The role of institutions
