The AI revolution is rapidly changing the world as we know it - and
ChatGPT is leading the way. In just two months after launch, it had
already reached 100 million users and is seen by many experts as a
potential game-changer when it comes to how humans live, learn, and
work. This class is designed to help students take full advantage of
ChatGPT and the AI revolution more broadly.

Most of us recognize that artificial intelligence has advanced to the
point of being able to do things like driving cars, reading lung scans,
or making better predictions about what we want to watch or buy than
humans. But how does this remarkable technology work? How can it cause
disruption in entire industries and render some high-level skills and
occupations useless? What topics do students need to learn in order to
succeed in an AI-dominated world?

In this class, Professor Balland provides high school students with the
tools they need to understand and excel in this new AI world. It covers
not only the basics of ChatGPT, but also tackles the macro-level
implications of AI on the economy. Technical principles of modern AI
algorithms will be introduced and students will be encouraged to think
critically about the skills and values that are needed to survive in a
world vastly different from what our current educational system prepares
us for. No specific math or programming experience is necessary - just a
deep curiosity about how ChatGPT-like models and AI will affect our
future.

\subsubsection{Structure of the class}\label{structure-of-the-class}}

The class consists of four distinct components: two lectures, one
tutorial, and a final pitch deck presentation. The first lecture
introduces ChatGPT and the sweeping impact of AI on our modern society,
giving students an overview of the business problems that AI can help to
solve. Then, the second lecture dives into the technical aspects of AI
algorithms. In the tutorial, students are invited to use ChatGPT to
build a recommendation system for a real-world problem of their choice,
as well as market research, and creating a slide deck. During the last
class, students will have the opportunity to present their big idea and
receive feedback. Students can join the class by following this
