### Course description  
Data is the world's most valuable resource. Data-driven health care saves lives, big data is a strong ally in the fight against climate change, and entirely shaped our lives. Data also fueled the growth of tech giants. In July 2020, Amazon was worth 1.5 trillion - which is equal to the entire GDP of Spain. In this context data science is one of the most important skills that students need nowadays. The explosion of big data also came together with growing concerns about data monopoly, privacy concerns, and new issues of algorithmic discrimination. This class is a tiny introduction to the immense world of quantitative and qualitative data science. It will help you to understand how to transform the unprecedented amount of data we have access to into meaningful, actionable insights. This course consists of online lectures combined with computer exercises and online tutorials. The main goal is to equip you with new very specific skills (in the R language), but also to invite you to think critically about data in different forms. Welcome to the data science journey!

### What you will learn  
1. What a data science paradigm is, and how it can be applied to geography  
2. Key concepts of Network Science, Big Data, AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning  
3. Key concepts of data analysis and visualization  
4. Basic programming skills in R and Nvivo    
5. Grounded theory
6. Qualitative methods

[Ilse van Liempt](https://www.uu.nl/staff/ICvanLiempt/Profile) - I.C.vanLiempt@uu.nl  
[Anne de Bruin](n.a.debruin@students.uu.nl) - n.a.debruin@students.uu.nl

### Computer Lab
No prior knowledge in quantitative methods or statistical computing is required to follow this course. We will use the R statistical software (open source) and Nvivo. Students will need a personal computer to follow this class.   

### Grading
The overall grade for the class will be based on a final exam (55%) and 3 assignments (45%).

### Assignments  
Assignments should be submitted to [this](https://www.dropbox.com/request/3TIcipjx2WXXhxP5IiZu) Dropbox folder. 

### Readings  
There is no class reader. The weekly readings are provided on this web-page and slides/videos will be regularly uploaded here. All articles listed should be considered mandatory reading. Additional online materials might be assigned throughout the quarter.
