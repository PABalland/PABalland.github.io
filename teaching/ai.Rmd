### Course description  
The AI revolution is taking the world by storm. We can only be mesmerized by intelligent machines driving cars, reading lung scans, or predicting what we will listen, watch, or buy better than humans. This extraordinary technology is still in its infancy but has already driven most of the S&P 500 recent growth while disrupting entire industries and rendering high-status skills completely obsolete. This class is an entry point to understand and thrive in this AI-shaped world. It addresses the macro-level impact of AI on the economy, introduces the technical principles and business applications of modern AI algorithms and invites students to critically think about the skills they need for a world so different from the ones our education system was designed for. 

### What students will learn  
1. What AI can and can not predict      
2. The building blocks of AI: network data structures   
4. How AI creates monopoly and winner-takes-all systems   
5. Build an AI recomandation system to solve a real world problem
