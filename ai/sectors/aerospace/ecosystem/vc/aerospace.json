Before founding ZeroAvia, eMotorWerks was acquired by international energy conglomerate Enel. A licensed pilot, Miftakhov saw an opportunity to pursue his dream of flying airplanes while also electrifying them and completely transforming commercial transportation. ZeroAvia developed a vision to serve as a responsible steward of the environment by bringing hydrogen-powered aircraft to the market. The hydrogen-electric powertrain technology vastly reduces carbon emissions and reduces noise, all while lowering fuel and maintenance costs for airlines. For ZeroAvia's promising HyFlyer I project, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) delivered the fueling systems necessary for test flights as well as infrastructure designed for airports. The HyFlyer II project will carry more passengers and fly up to 500 miles, with the ambitious goal of seating up to 100 passengers and traveling more than 1,000 miles by 2030. As consumer preferences shift toward other methods of travel due to concerns about sustainability, and with the airline industry battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, ZeroAvia is capitalizing on the need for carbon-free transportation options. British Airways has formed a partnership with ZeroAvia to achieve its net-zero goal by 2050. Upon receiving $21.4 million in series A funding in conjunction with $16.3 million in grant funds from the UK government from the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), ZeroAvia has raised $49.7 million from inception to bring hydrogen fuel cells to the market by 2023.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Basic Electric Elements","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Vehicles","country":"United States","region":"California","city":"Hollister"},{"id":"Hanwha Systems","value":251000000,"value2":1,"parent":"East Asia and Pacific","color":"#365a94","Industries":"Aerospace, Electronics, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Manufacturing","HeadquartersLocation":"Seoul, Seoul-t'ukpyolsi, South Korea","FullDescription":"Hanwha Systems is a global solution company, the merged corporation is leading the defense electronics industry based on the advanced ICT technology and providing differentiated solutions in the finance and manufacturing, construction, and service industries.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"South Korea","region":"Seoul-t'ukpyolsi","city":"Seoul"},{"id":"Astrobotic Technology","value":249630200,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Aerospace, Information Technology, Robotics","HeadquartersLocation":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States","FullDescription":"Astrobotic Technology Inc. is a Pittsburgh based company that delivers affordable space robotics technology and planetary missions.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Aircraft; Aviation; Cosmonautics","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Transport, packaging and storing","country":"United States","region":"Pennsylvania","city":"Pittsburgh"},{"id":"XAG","value":248351289,"value2":1,"parent":"East Asia and Pacific","color":"#365a94","Industries":"Aerospace, Agriculture, Drones, Farming, Innovation Management, Manufacturing","HeadquartersLocation":"Guangzhou, Guangdong, China","FullDescription":"XAircraft is a multi-rotor design and manufacturing company hailing from China with a global footprint of International Distributors.

The Graflight V-8 is unlike anything that has ever been put inside a general aviation airplane and the results can be seen in virtually every aspect of its performance and design. Though it is of comparable weight and size, the Graflight V-8 has shown up to 40 percent fuel savings when matched against comparable turbine engines.  The engine increases range by up to 50 percent or payload by up to 40 percent compared to Avgas-powered aircraft. When compared with other aviation diesels, it is still 15 percent more fuel efficient because unlike those engines, it was built specifically to meet the requirements of flight.  It is also the cleanest and greenest engine ever manufactured for the GA market, cutting CO2 emissions by 30 percent over comparable Avgas engines and by 17 percent over competing diesel engines. In fact, if this engine could be installed in every car in America, it would cut fuel consumption across the board by 30 percent – just imagine!","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Hot-Gas Or Combustion-Product Engine Plants","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Machines and machine tools","country":"United States","region":"Wisconsin","city":"New Richmond"},{"id":"Whisper Aero","value":40500000,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Aerospace, Air Transportation, GreenTech","HeadquartersLocation":"Crossville, Tennessee, United States","FullDescription":"Whisper Aero is harnessing the power of air more cleanly, efficiently, and quietly than ever before.

We are first and foremost a business. We aim to extract resources from asteroids to boost the Earth's economy and kick start the Space Based Economy as the vast values of some asteroids can be valued in trillions, with the largest asteroids being worth quintillions, while even small asteroids can be hugely valuable. This money will be spent in building ever growing amounts of space infrastructure so that we can eventually allow all humans who desire it to live and work in Space. Our team is currently working in partnership with the Space Robotics Lab at Tohoku University, Japan, developing SCAR-E. These low-cost, ruggedised, walking and climbing robots will be capable of undertaking asteroid, planetary and lunar exploration, alongside mining operations.   Designed to withstand exposure to radiation, high accelerations experienced during space launch, and extreme temperatures, SCAR-E will be capable of in-orbit asset maintenance such as spacewalking and extravehicular activity.

For semiconductor companies and electronic device manufactures with stringent requirements in terms of safety and security, Hex Five’s Trusted Firmware provides secure boot, device attestation, remote firmware updates, telemetry, real-time monitoring, and scalable secure communications. Unlike traditional firmware, which is built as a monolithic blob of trusted and untrusted functionality, Hex Five’s Trusted Firmware is completely self-contained and isolated from the rest of the system thanks to the underlying Hex Five’s patented MultiZone® TEE technology. With Hex Five, companies throughout the semiconductor value chain benefit from stronger security, reduced development costs, times and risks, and the flexibility to safely integrate readily available multi-sourced hardware and software components. PATENTED TECHNOLOGY Securing embedded devices has become increasingly difficult as complex new requirements are often met with the addition of readily available 3 rd party components that cannot always be trusted. Most embedded devices lack the hardware resources to provide the necessary separation, thus leading to larger attack surface and increased system vulnerability. To shield critical functionality from untrusted third-party components, Hex Five has designed, developed, and patented MultiZone® Security, a truly innovative Trusted Execution Environment providing hardware-enforced software-defined separation of multiple functional domains within the same chip. Complexity is the enemy of security. To simplify the development process, and to minimize the risk for human error, MultiZone encapsulates and hides the complexity of managing the underlying hardware security blocks exposing their functionality as a set of policies. The only interaction between the developer and Hex Five’s Trusted Execution Environment is a simple policy definition file. No security expertise is necessary and no coding is required – or in fact even allowed.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Computing; Calculating","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments","country":"United States","region":"California","city":"Redwood City"},{"id":"Aquarian Space","value":760000,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Aerospace, Communications Infrastructure, Satellite Communication","HeadquartersLocation":"Boulder, Colorado, United States","FullDescription":"Aquarian Space is a developer of a communication network for interplanetary exploration.

The reason behind the creation of these new engines is simple: today's electric aircraft can only use propeller-based electromagnetic motors, so they fly at low speeds. The world record is only 623 km/h for an electric aircraft, and the speed limit is about 1000 km/h. Our electric, plasma-based jet engines work differently. Instead of relying on electromagnetism like today's electric motors, they rely on thermodynamics like today's fuel-based jet engines. Usually, fuel is burned into the combustion chamber to heat the air at approximately 1700 °C, which generates CO2. The expansion of air due to the heat accelerates it toward the exhaust, where it generates thrust by leaving the engine at high speed. In our case, we use the same principle of heating the air to accelerate it. However, we heat it using electricity only, and we heat it so much that we generate a plasma, far above 2000 °C, without emitting CO2.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"France","region":"Aquitaine","city":"Mérignac"},{"id":"Rogue Space Systems","value":500000,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Aerospace, Manufacturing, Robotics","HeadquartersLocation":"Laconia, New Hampshire, United States","FullDescription":"Rogue designs satellite vehicles and subsystems to provide satellite operators with on-orbit services now and in the future.
