Befect,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/befect,"Befect(Beyond limits of artificial intelligence with perfection) -The reason why ""Befect"" was born We consider life extension, human security-UNDP, and sustainable human development as the top priorities. In realizing these three values, human power alone is too big, too hard, and lacking to do many things, but I think all of this will be possible when artificial intelligence which has the same thoughts as us has replaces all of those things on our behalf. There are various thoughts in a person's head, but everything can't come up right away, and it's very difficult to find what you want by combining the thoughts in your head. Therefore, when it is difficult to recall thoughts, people are indifferent or sad and pass by. If you can remember the thoughts you want in your head right away, your choice will become clearer, and if the memory is very special, you can combine new information to get another choice or better results. Through the process, you can clearly see what you want, and through this, you will be able to understand all the characteristics. We see all the people in the world who see, feel, and think as independent beings. Knowing all the characteristics of such independent people will provide the best satisfaction, and we will try to create new technologies or information by introducing and applying the characteristics to artificial intelligence. I think artificial intelligence can achieve great achievements in creating a better world of new information and products, rules, society, and culture in the future. -Befect is.. Understand the basic concepts and meanings that people think and understand the characteristics of the data perfectly. Define and understand data most quickly and accurately and learn on its own. It is the most advanced technology for machines to understand humans and the first artificial intelligence that machines themselves can grasp and understand information most quickly and completely. Traditional artificial intelligence has reached a breakthrough level of performance, often approaching and sometimes surpassing the capabilities of human experts. However, while we could identify the right information from the accumulated information, we couldn't create a model with better new characteristics because of the limited information, so it was impossible to define it perfectly. As a result, it was not known what kind of thoughts and criteria the data created by artificial intelligence was created. No matter how good the results and performance are, it will leave a lot of risk and trial and error to use or graft to the level that humans want. This is because they deal with it in the same way as humans, but they do not have insights through deep thoughts and thoughts in thinking or dealing with problems. Befect fully understands the basic concept of data and has built a new characteristic model of the completed definition with characteristic data. We're trying to define from the units of molecules to the stages of forming new consciousness Befect AI is the first artificial intelligence that can be defined on its own. A new idea that opens up a new future is about to begin. Befect will turn possibilities into reality. Befect can be such hope. However, human power cannot solve and achieve everything. Humans will be able to survive and thrive only when they solve all the problems that may arise inside and outside the Earth (space) through coexistence with machines. Artificial intelligence will be the most important last invention in human history with the potential to predict and determine the future of mankind. Our mission is to move toward an era of space pioneering and a new era starting with a new civilization while solving various problems facing mankind through artificial intelligence technology. Beyond the great leap of mankind, the construction of a new future for the eternal prosperity of mankind. Befect will be the first company to make artificial intelligence a reality. We will go beyond artificial intelligence and become a pioneer in the beginning of a new future drawn through artificial intelligence and the journey of the universe.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, Machine Learning","Seoul, Seoul-t'ukpyolsi, South Korea",Befect AI is the first artificial intelligence that can be defined on its own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Asia-Pacific (APAC),,,,,,Private

SkyDeck AI,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/skydeck-ai,"SkyDeck AI offers generative AI services to enhance operations and productivity for businesses and developers, their customers and for all users of AI. SkyDeck AI has two main products: Rememberizer at Rememberizer.ai (and learn more at try.rememberizer.ai), and GenStudio located at skydeck.ai. Rememberizer is designed to integrate, embed, and guard user knowledge as they share it sparingly with the AI apps that they use. It allows app developers with a way of letting their users quickly onboard their knowledge into the developer's app in a way that is generalized and allows them to stay in control. It allows owners of knowledge to share that with the larger community through ""Common Knowledge"".  Rememberizer also provides direct access to a vector database as a service, and in that way competes directly with companies like Pinecone. Rememberizer integrates with Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Dropbox, and more. It also allows data to be uploaded directly from a synced folder. Rememberizer easily integrates with OpenAI GPTs in as little as a few minutes, and with custom applications. Popular applications include enabling users to talk to use genAI to talk to their Slack Channel, Sub-Reddit, Gmail, and other shared repositories of knowledge.  GenStudio provides a teams and business oriented platform for deploying conversational AI workspaces throughout an organization. It is distinct for its focus on security, centralized management, managed app deployment, low cost, and ability to operate in a vendor agnostic way using many LLMs public and private. Skydeck's GenStudio is just one business user of Rememberizer, injecting private user and business knowledge into business conversations.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Generative AI, IaaS, SaaS","San Jose, California, United States",AI vector knowledge management and workspace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,Private
