Faceter,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/faceter,"Faceter is a video surveillance and security platform based on artificial vision technology and an approach that involves analyzing the chain of events happening in the frame and responding to them. We call it ""the event-based security model"". Most of the video surveillance software products currently available on the market operate in two categories: time of recording and source. This means a user can only see what was recorded at a particular time frame on each of the installed cameras. Faceter makes video surveillance systems much more capable by adding face recognition technology. Faceter can build a list of office workers, family members, restaurant patrons; generate a report on who was detected and when, in the cameras' scope; find each occurrence of a specific person at a specific location and retrieve specific records from the archive.Faceter can be taught to respond to certain events. For example, the system can send SMS to parents when their child arrives from school, and transmit information to integrated systems via available APIs. It could be a smart house management platform that will send a command to warm up food in the microwave. In the next two years we will make Faceter support protocols for several leading smart house platforms and standard callback APIs. When integrated with urban services, Faceter can be configured to perform specific actions, such as sending alerts to 911 if there are signs of violence or incipient crime.","Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Facial Recognition, Machine Learning, SaaS, Security, Smart Building, Smart Home","San Jose, California, United States","Intelligent Software for Smarter Surveillance, based of facial recognition and video stream real time analysis, is distributed as SaaS",28610352,USD,28610352,,,,,12,,28610352,USD,28610352,"43,632",,,28610352,USD,28610352,1,2018-02-07,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",$1M to $10M,JaMes Sowers,,,,Private,,2014-01-08,day,For Profit,https://fog.faceter.cam,https://www.linkedin.com/company/18415519/,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Privacy and Security, Real Estate, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Robert Pothier, Vladimir Tchernitski",11-50,,Initial Coin Offering,28610352,USD,28610352,Initial Coin Offering,,1,,,"72,888","72,518",,,,,,,,,,,,

Machine learning is used to immediately and accurately identify compromised credentials and database attacks. Customers gain insights and a situational awareness of IT infrastructure including four primary benefits:     * Non-intrusively and continuously discovering all databases     * Deep analysis into database activity     * Pinpoint insider threats     * Artificial intelligence identifies insider threats DB Networks continuous database infrastructure monitoring ""shines a light"" on what's really going on in your infrastructure. For example, undocumented and unmanaged databases may contain highly sensitive information and offer cyber attackers an enormously large attack surface. DB Networks non-intrusively discovers all databases and the interactions of users and applications to their connected databases. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) operating inside the core network introduce new, or alter user/application interactions. DB Networks maps all of these application interactions to rapidly identify APTs. Continuous monitoring the core network also identifies policy violations such as restricted databases being exposed to unrestricted network segments. DB Networks’ unique approach to intelligent database security utilizes machine learning and behavioral analysis to automatically create models of each applications proper interactions with their connected databases. These models are used to immediately and accurately identify database attacks.

In November 2018, MediPixel won the championship in the QuickFire Challenge hosted by Johnson & Johnson.  MediPixel currently offers three solutions for intervention surgeons: 1. An AI Based Diagnosis Solution makes it possible for doctors to spot lesions while performing a coronary angiography, perform segmentation of the vessel in question within just one second and analyze the lesion’s status. 2. A Guide & Planning Solution clearly visualizes the hidden part of the coronary artery to make doctors perform guidewire manipulation with more ease and confidence, which is quite useful especially in case of CTO. Furthermore, the solution frees doctors from the need to use contrast -- this is important because contrast can cause potentially fatal reactions in 5 to 10% of patients. 3. An Automated Navigation Engine automates navigation through coronary arteries. Once the destination is reached, it controls a robotic unit by giving the most appropriate real-time commands in its existing situation, thus delivering devices such as guidewire to the destination in the most efficient way.

Perceptive Automata,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perceptive-automata,"Perceptive Automata is solving what is often described as the hardest of the hard problems for automated driving: human behavior prediction technology for the safe large-scale rollout of highly automated (L2/3) and autonomous (L4/5) vehicles, especially in urban areas. The company enables those vehicles to understand what people might do next so they can navigate safely and smoothly around humans, including pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers. The level of understanding of our human-like AI goes well beyond what standard physics-based approaches can deliver, including information that can’t be gained any other way. Importantly, in addition to increased safety, we enable a much more natural and smooth human-like driving of L4/5 autonomous vehicles. This is essential for autonomous vehicles to be accepted into a human-dominated road environment and also by passengers of robotaxi services. Without this capability autonomous vehicles simply will not function well enough.

Makersite,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/makersite-gmbh,"Makersite is a cloud-based product data management tool that helps companies manage product sustainability, cost, and compliance. Product life cycle management involves making design decisions based on multiple criteria including cost, compliance, sustainability, and risk. Unfortunately, the data and expertise required to make these decisions are siloed. This protracts the process of innovation and increases its complexity.  Today, the market solves this problem with vertical applications like PDM, ERP, CAD, EHS, SCM, etc. These mostly remain siloed due to the enormous costs of integration and keeping data synchronized. Therefore, analyses typically require exporting data to aggregation tools e.g. BI or excel before being used for analyses in specialist decision support applications. Results are typically delayed, some taking as much as 9 months, and therefore provide little support during the design process. Makersite provides results instantly and simultaneously across key product criteria. Makersite combines external and internal data sources to create a digital twin of a product in design. Artificial intelligence and its graph-based data model allow for ingesting, representing, and connecting heterogeneous data easily. Its native applications use algorithms to support analysis and decision-making based on multiple criteria simultaneously including should-costs, regulatory compliance, life cycle impacts (LCA), supply chain risk, etc. The API-first architecture allows for easy integrations into existing IT infrastructures thereby supporting systems and processes with richer, fresher, and more timely product data. This allows engineers to understand and improve their designs from the perspective of their regulatory compliance, environmental impact, supply risk, and cost of production, simultaneously. Companies can get results up to 40x faster than traditional methods while making their products better.","Analytics, Big Data, Compliance, Data Management, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Product Management, Productivity Tools, Software, Supply Chain Management","Stuttgart, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany","Makersite is a cloud-based product data management tool that helps companies manage product sustainability, cost, and compliance.",18271429,EUR,18031896,,,,"9,023",39,,18200000,EUR,17950028,,,,18200000,EUR,17950028,5,2022-10-18,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",Less than $1M,"Translink Capital, Planet A Ventures, Hitachi Ventures, KOMPAS VC, Aerospace Xelerated",,,,Private,70173,2018-01-01,year,For Profit,https://makersite.io,https://www.linkedin.com/company/makersitede,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Other, Professional Services, Software, Transportation",1,Neil Dsouza,51-100,Early Stage Venture,Series A,18200000,EUR,17950028,Series A,4,7,,,"65,115","64,801",,,,,,,,,,,,

JANZZ.technology,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/janzz,"JANZZ.technology is a technology and consulting company active in semantic skills and job matching, solutions and applications for the use of complex occupation and skills data, and the development and marketing of economically sustainable projects. JANZZ.technology was originally founded in Zurich in 2008. It is a genuine Swiss company that since the start has been operated by serious investors and experienced personalities from the fields of information and communications technology, human resources, jurisprudence, marketing and business development. The goals of JANZZ.technology are clear: in addition to viable and sustainable business development, the company is strongly focused on ensuring that its products and solutions offer real economic and social benefit. Everyone should be able to benefit from JANZZ.technology, not only in Switzerland, but worldwide. JANZZ.technology launched its first product at the end of 2010: JANZZ.jobs, an innovative employment matching platform designed to reinvigorate labor and job markets, considerably improve on the systems previously used in portals of this kind, and optimize the operations of public employment services. Since 2013 three more, powerful SaaS B2B and B2G solutions were launched – JANZZon!, JANZZclassifier! and JANZZsme! – together with the simple, secure JANZZjobsAPI interface. These solutions, which are superior to conventional full-text-based technologies and applications, have been used in a variety of combinations and applications for structuring and efficiently and intelligently using the large volumes of data available today relating to professional qualifications and hard and soft skills (known as occupation data), as they increase rapidly in complexity. With its cutting-edge solutions, JANZZ.technology is taking a bold step to advance the new area of cognitive computing in the field of occupations and skills. The era of cognitive computing is characterized by a fundamental shift in how machines interact with us, other machines and the environment. The ontology JANZZon! and the smart matching engine JANZZsme! make complex problems such as job and skills matching computable and completely change the way they think and go about job searching. As the applications of JANZZ.technology are structured semantically, that is, occupations, skills and many more concepts are interlinked logically, they can deliver meaningful results for complex searches for job vacancies, employees, freelancers etc. Importantly, these applications constantly learn and therefore become more accurate over time. According to Gartner, the era of cognitive computing, also called the smart machine era will be the most disruptive in the history of IT.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, Career Planning, Employment, Enterprise Software, Government, Recruiting, SaaS, Semantic Web, Software","Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland",JANZZ.technology is a technology and consulting company active in semantic skills and job matching.,15680853,USD,15680853,,,0,,29,6,15680853,USD,15680853,,,,4127000,CHF,4636688,9,2021-01-01,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",$1M to $10M,"Publigroupe S.A., Oprandi & Partner, Roberto Oprandi, Network Capital Holding AG, Hans-Ulrich Doerig",,,3,Private,8038,2009-06-05,day,For Profit,http://www.janzz.technology,https://www.linkedin.com/company/4u-group-ag,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Government and Military, Internet Services, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Stefan Winzenried,11-50,Seed,Seed,4127000,CHF,4636688,Seed,,17,,,"39,670","39,547",,,,,,,,,,,,
