Oculii's AI software amplifies the resolution of any radar platform, enabling high performance perception for the next generation of autonomous systems. Traditional phased array radars have been used for decades and follow a strict size for performance tradeoff - the larger the sensor aperture, the higher the angular resolution. Oculii’s Virtual Aperture Imaging radar technology fundamentally breaks this tradeoff - enabling its sensors to trade increased compute/processing for angular resolution enhancement with the same physical aperture. Leveraging this technique enables Oculii sensors to extract unprecedented accuracy, range, and 4D positioning information from commodity off the shelf low-cost radar elements, bringing high resolution radar imaging to the next frontier.

CAST AI brings resource and cost optimization to Kubernetes using an AI-driven optimization engine that applies cluster changes based on real-time workload conditions. It selects the most cost-effective instance types and bin-packs pods for maximum utilization. The platform uses spot instances that offer 70 to 90% discounts and are automatically selected for any stateless workloads. CAST AI also sets pod scaling parameters to achieve optimal application performance while maximizing cost savings. Moreover, users get detailed cost reports to enable forecasting expenses at the level of the project, cluster, namespace, and deployment, down to individual microservices. CAST AI provides an opinionated Kubernetes implementation that hides the infrastructure complexities with automation. So DevOps engineers no longer have to deal with IaaS complexity and can finally focus on higher-order cloud-native abstractions and concepts. They can create and manage CAST AI components through API, CLI, and Terraform to automate their infrastructure lifecycle management. CAST AI also provides services for in-cluster observability (logging, tracing, and metrics) and built-in security (encryption at rest and in transit). CAST AI protects workloads against downtime with a Disaster Avoidance strategy based on cloud neutrality and multi-cloud capabilities. To achieve 100% uptime, CAST AI adopts the active approach to Disaster Recovery by stretching applications and data across multiple clouds so that a cloud failure never becomes a disaster.
