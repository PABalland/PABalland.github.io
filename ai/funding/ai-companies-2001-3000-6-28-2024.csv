Dune Security,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dune-security,"AI fighting AI. CISOs face an impossible risk landscape today.  80% of cybersecurity breaches start because of employee error.  The problem is exacerbating with generative AI, as a single hacker can specifically target thousands of employees in the same amount of time that they used to specifically target tens of employees with social engineering.  CISOs lack tools to deal with employee risk and are held accountable when a breach inevitably happens. By leveraging AI at each step, Dune Security empowers organizations to quantify individual risk through analyzing user behavior, context, learning patterns, and third party data. This allows the automation of tailored cybersecurity measures to each individual, transforming vulnerabilities into strengths. Dune is the central engine of all employee risk data, which is a solution that is not just timely for organizations but necessary in navigating the present cybersecurity landscape. This gives the CISO the capability to understand who are the high risk employees, to what extent, and why - as well as automatically remediate and restrict access to keep their organization safe. Today, Dune Security uniquely replaces legacy and ineffective security awareness training by pinpointing the crucial 8% of employees responsible for 80% of the risk, ensuring all employees receive personalized, machine learning-driven training tailored to their risk profile. CISOs also have easy access to quantifiable data via robust reporting and API-out capability, enabling them to both report to compliance auditors, regulators, and insurance underwriters, as well as restrict access to high-risk employees through other security systems.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber Security, Information Technology, SaaS","New York, New York, United States",Dune Security uses AI to pioneer Employee Security Posture Management and reduce the attack surface for every enterprise.,2000000,USD,2000000,,,,"1,348",4,,2000000,USD,2000000,,,,2000000,USD,2000000,1,2023-05-23,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,"Antler, Alumni Ventures, Firestreak Ventures, Sequoia Capital (SSF), Craft Ventures",,,,Private,,2023-05-16,day,For Profit,https://dunesecurity.io,https://www.linkedin.com/company/dune-security/,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"David DellaPelle, Michael Waite",1-10,Seed,Pre-Seed,2000000,USD,2000000,Pre-Seed,1,6,,,"10,721","10,708"

Our customers are CPOs (e.g. EnBW, Recharge, EDP, Iberdrola), Fleet Operators (e.g. Total), OEMs (e.g. Porsche), Telematics providers (e.g. Autosense), and Mobility Service Providers (e.g. Elbil, ANWB). They use our Routing-API to power solutions for individual EV-drivers and EV-fleets; owned, leased, rented, shared, and autonomous. Our routing engine uses over 15 different (dynamic) variables to calculate the real-time range of any EV (currently 260+ EV models). Proprietary algorithms then compute the best route from A, to B (to C, to D) with the optimal charge stations in between; specific to that vehicle, to that journey, business logic, and fleet specs. Build-in predictive models optimize for total travel-time and travel-costs.  Chargetrip’s API is easy to integrate into existing charge-, navigation-, Fleet operating, and telematics applications. On average, over 175.000 EV drivers use our software every month; equal to 10% of all EV’s in Europe.","Electric Vehicle, Navigation, Predictive Analytics, SaaS, Software","Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, The Netherlands",Chargetrip offers Smart EV Routing as an API SaaS platform.,10000000,EUR,10773192,,,,"35,550",24,,10000000,EUR,10773192,,,,,,,5,2023-07-27,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,"Elemental Excelerator, Blue Bear Capital, APX, TotalEnergies, TotalEnergies Ventures",,,,Private,1011VL,2017-02-01,day,For Profit,http://www.chargetrip.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/chargetrip/,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Navigation and Mapping, Software, Transportation",4,"Andreas Sansano, Gideon van Dijk, Mark Hulsbergen, Pieter Waller",11-50,Early Stage Venture,Series A,,,,Series A,3,10,,,"11,017","11,003"

Dreamdata,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dreamdata-io,"In B2B, the biggest challenge marketers face is connecting their activities with revenue. There are just too many touchpoints and people involved in the buying decision, resulting in complex buyer journeys and long sales cycles. Transparency gets lost.  Everyone knows that B2B revenue attribution is important, but where do you even start? The bigger the ad spend, the bigger the potential... but also the pain! To try and solve this, a lot of companies still rely on attribution systems that are stitched together in Excel from a mix of ill-maintained B2C tools (e.g. Google Analytics and Facebook attribution), giving them a skewed view of their revenue reality.  We’ve been there! In our previous jobs, we searched for a product that could replace our scrappy semi-solutions without draining internal resources: a solution that would continue to get developed and actually help us understand the full value of our actions. We couldn’t find one. So we decided to build one ourselves. Enter Dreamdata, the B2B revenue attribution platform for small to midsize B2B companies who have the ambition to be truly data-driven. Our customers typically close multiple deals a month and do inside sales with a significant digital ad spend and annual revenue ranging from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars. We pull together and clean existing, siloed, commercial data sources before joining them with behavioral data to give a holistic reflection of the actual B2B customer journey and transform it into easy-to-digest, actionable analysis.  Dreamdata integrates with just about any commercial tool and traffic source, so your teams won’t be forced to use certain vendors or suites. You’re free to use best-in-class tools! What if you were asked to double next year's ad spend? What if a pandemic strikes and you’re suddenly forced to cut your marketing activities by 50%? What would you do? Do you actually trust your data enough to present a sound way forward? In situations like these, there’s nothing more dangerous than bad data. What might look like a good plan you want to act on can actually be a bad decision in disguise. Is your B2B’s data prepared and ready to go?  By taking care of all the data-crunching, Dreamdata allows demand generation and commercial ops professionals to focus on which B2B go-to-market (GTM) efforts are actually paying off and enables them to repeat the success and stop wasting money.  Our out-of-the-box platform helps you to answer vital B2B marketing questions like which campaigns and channels to stop or scale, what’s the return on ad spend, and how long it takes to acquire new customers. If you’re all about granularity it’s even possible to do attribution to (and between!) every pipeline stage as well. Applying attribution to pipeline stages allows Dreamdata customers to optimize every step of their customer journeys.  With the Dreamdata insights, B2B marketing and sales align like never before. B2Bs need to realize that revenue creation is most effective when it’s done as a team effort. Every touch of every deal is disclosed. No more guesswork. No more opinions. With this unrivaled transparency, it’s not unusual to see campaign effectiveness and marketing ROI improve by more than 50%.","Analytics, B2B, Cloud Data Services, Data Integration, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics","Copenhagen, Hovedstaden, Denmark",Dreamdata is a B2B revenue automation platform.

In 1988, Wonderware transformed how machines run, with the introduction and mass commercialization of Human-Machine Interface software. Wonderware enabled the first software-based industrial revolution and is still in evidence today by Wonderware’s continued leadership position. In 1998, Lighthammer transformed manufacturing yet again with the introduction of the first Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence platform. Lighthammer revolutionized the factory floor by bringing both real time intelligence and live synchronization with the ERP software layer. This enabled the second software-based industrial revolution and is still evidenced today by the ubiquity of this software (currently under the SAP MII brand). In 2008, ThingWorx catalyzed the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with the introduction of the first application platform for IIoT. ThingWorx transformed both manufacturing and service, becoming synonymous with Industrie 4.0/Brilliant factory, and Connected Service. This enabled the 3rd software-based industrial revolution and is still evidenced today by the ubiquity of IIoT software and, the market leadership of PTC’s ThingWorx brand. In 2018, the founders of Augmentir recognized that the technology and market forces were aligned yet again, for a fourth industrial software revolution. A revolution focused on increasing the productivity & quality of processes involving front-line workers. With a global footprint of 350 million workers in manufacturing and service, they are being asked to perform increasingly complex jobs using technology that has remained relatively unchanged for 20 years. Whether this was due to neglect or the misplaced belief that robots and automation would replace all of these jobs, these users and processes have been underserved.","Machine Learning, Software","Horsham, Pennsylvania, United States",Augmentir enables rapid and sustainable digital transformation for industrial companies.,7500000,USD,7500000,,,,"4,795",33,,7500000,USD,7500000,22,,,,,,3,2023-04-18,"Greater Philadelphia Area, Great Lakes, Northeastern US",$500M to $1B,"Pritzker Group Venture Capital, Holt Ventures, Lerer Hippeau, Gardner Lewis Asset Management",,,,Private,19044,2018-01-01,year,For Profit,https://www.augmentir.com/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/augmentir/,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Software",4,"John Canosa, Lawrence Fan, Phil Huber, Russell Fadel",11-50,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,2,4,,,"11,795","11,780"
