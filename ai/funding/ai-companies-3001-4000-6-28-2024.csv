Samdesk,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sam,"SAM turns unstructured social media into actionable insight and awareness. It also operates a social media management platform for newsrooms. The company allows newsrooms to curate, collaborate, search, annotate, verify, and process around social content, as well as publish and tell stories with social content. When the unexpected occurs, every second count - millions of dollars are often lost in just the first few minutes after an emergency. Having accurate and relevant data on the location and impact of an emergency event as it unfolds is of paramount importance to those in corporate security, public safety, and emergency response. However, obtaining this information using traditional news media and data analysts is expensive, slow, and prone to error.  SAM Inc. has developed a novel tool which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the location of emergency events based on social media chatter. Their proprietary algorithm scans millions of social media posts to detect events such as fire, flooding, tornado, or terrorist attacks, at their earliest stages based on unstructured social media chatter. Following the detection of an event, we use AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to verify the source and triangulate location. This information is then provided to decision-makers so they can take appropriate action quickly and monitor the situation as it unfolds in time and space, minimizing the impact on business operations and risk to personnel. When the unexpected happens, every second counts and SAM provides minutes.

Created by Albert Technologies Ltd. in 2010, Albert’s mission is to liberate businesses from the complexities of digital marketing – not just by replicating their existing efforts, but by executing them at a pace and scale not previously possible. He serves as a highly intelligent and sophisticated member of brands’ marketing teams, wading through mass amounts of data, converting this data into insights, and autonomously acting on these insights, across channels, devices and formats, in real time. This eliminates the manual and time-consuming tasks that currently limit the effectiveness and results of modern digital advertising and marketing. Brands such as Harley Davidson, EVISU, Cosabella, and Made.com credit Albert with significantly increased sales, an accelerated path to revenue, the ability to make more informed investment decisions, and reduced operational costs.","Advertising, Advertising Platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Marketing, Enterprise Software, Lead Generation, Machine Learning, Marketing, Marketing Automation, Semantic Search","New York, New York, United States","Albert is an artificial intelligence marketing platform for the enterprise, driving fully autonomous digital marketing campaigns.",18000000,USD,18000000,2017-07-14,day,,"11,362",7,34,18000000,USD,18000000,,,,18000000,USD,18000000,1,2018-07-04,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",$1M to $10M,"Merian Global Investors, Schroder Ventures, Hargreave Hale",,,,Public,10018,2010-01-01,year,For Profit,https://www.albert.ai,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1251176,,,"Advertising, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Or Shani,51-100,M&A,Post-IPO Equity,18000000,USD,18000000,Post-IPO Equity,,3,,Was Acquired,"14,295","14,274",,,,,,,,,,,,

With a near-endless music library featuring more than 100 musical categories, users can search by genre, mood and activity to find the perfect song for their project. Mubert, a platform trusted by thousands of content creators and companies like Banuba, BetterMe, Sensorium, Adidas, InsightTimer, Restream, MacPaw and Crello, can help you find the music you need.

With a variety of license types, dynamic presets for streaming and over 1 million samples from more than 4,000 musicians, it is one of the most powerful and versatile music licensing platforms around. Stand Out From The Crowd – Music For Content Creators Content creators often struggle with sifting through thousands of stock audio tracks in search of the “perfect soundtrack.” Unfortunately, stock music never quite fits. Using YouTube tune library can be just as fruitless for the unique content creator, as many of these tracks have been used by millions of creators before. With Mubert, content creators gain access to real-time generative music and pre-made tracks, which they may Render with the genre, mood and length, allowing for more customization than ever before. The platform has more than 100 genres and a large selection of attributes, such as mood, tempo and genre, to help creators find the right music for their project fast. App creators enjoy the adaptive nature of Mubert’s music, which helps increase the in-app and in-game user experience. From casual Twitch and Youtube Streamers to app-building gurus, the platform provides unique, custom-made music with a single subscription. Music Without Strikes or Copyright Infringements Fears of copyright/DMCA claims and strikes can hinder a content creator’s ability to work freely. One mistake and hours of work could be tossed down the drain due to unexpected or unpredictable platform algorithms. People often end up dealing with stock websites that don’t have the correct license, websites with inaccurate license descriptions, licenses that don’t cover the necessary content, or licenses that aren’t available in all countries. When content creators use Mubert, they never have to worry about music licensing or confusing royalty agreements. The beauty of Mubert is that all of the music on our platform is royalty-free and available for use worldwide. Our licenses and sub-licenses are 100% DMCA-friendly and compatible with a number of platforms, i.e., YouTube, Twitch, Facebook and more. Plus, when you license music through Mubert, you get support from licensing professionals who can help you with any questions you might have! Empowering Artists With nominal commissions, hungry publishing companies and an unstable industry, artists often find it difficult to diversify their income. Here at Mubert, we understand the importance of artists, musicians and producers, which is why we collaborate with them using unique frameworks so that they can monetize their music. When artists work with Mubert, they receive a platform on which they can express themselves and earn real money on their work. When a content creator licenses music from Mubert, they are licensing high-quality, pro-level audio material made with the involvement of independent music producers.

Within 8 months from launch, we are already integrated with the largest fashion retailer in South East Asia and is partnering with worlds’ largest fashion retailers and brands to rebuild the online shopping fashion experiences. Studies show that shoppers are 25% more likely to convert after using our virtual dressing room.   You might have heard about virtual dressing rooms applications for decades but wonder why they are still not widely adopted nowadays when everything is moving digital. The truth is: many start-ups tried, but none of them created a solution that can scale economically while maintaining the quality standards to be appealing. Revery’s co-founders have unlocked such technology through Ph.D. research and are bringing it to the market! Our core algorithm can instantly produce high-fidelity images of people wearing selected outfits only using existing catalog images.
