Terminal.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/terminal-com,"We built a hypercloud with bare-metal performance.  A hypercloud is a 100% software configurable virtual datacenter that lives on top of physical hardware securely in your private datacenter, on the public clouds of AWS, GCE, and Azure, and on your laptop. Virtual Machines tax performance.  Containers are too new and insecure, forcing you to redesign app deployment flow. The hypercloud unit of computation is the Terminal Machine (TM, or just Terminal).  TMs are the best of both worlds: you get the security and familiarity of full operating system instances with the bare-metal speed and efficiency of containers. TMs rebalance and migrate seamlessly without reboot to maximize efficiency of your cluster.  Terminals resize from 1 CPU to 32 CPUs and 50GB of RAM when you need the power, in seconds, with no reboot. They automatically pause or shrink back down to save you money. “The software-defined data center is 10 years away,” they say. “The public cloud is too insecure,” they say. The hypercloud is the best of both worlds: you get the abstraction and power of the cloud, with the security of running everything in your own datacenter, plus the benefits of a hybrid cloud if you want both. Today. Who uses Terminal.com? Our users range from web app developers who spin up copies of their website in 5 seconds for QA and testing, to neuroscientists who analyze large FMRI datasets on computers that scale instantly, to online schools who teach people how to code using Terminal.com. RailsBridge relies on Terminal.com to teach first-time female engineers to code Ruby on Rails.  Top consultants at ZS Associates crunch numbers on our platform for data science tasks every day.  Professors at Carnegie-Mellon use Terminal.com to teach 100-student courses with no wasted effort.  Engineers across Silicon Valley know that Terminal.com is the easiest and most powerful tool for conducting coding interviews. Terminal.com provides the full suite of tools for the modern developer. How did Terminal.com start? When Varun Ganapathi’s family moved from India to Boston, Massachusetts in the 1980's, they started a small company called Terminal Exchange Systems. The company provided terminals to local companies so that they could remotely access huge, main-frame computers. Varun Ganapathi helped his father carry machines door to door, renting out both the hardware and software to local businesses. As he grew up, Varun’s commitment to computing didn’t disappear. He completed his computer science PhD at Stanford, sold over 1 million copies of his paid photography mobile app, Pro HDR, and sold his second company, Numovis, to Google. After two years as a Google Senior Research Scientist, Varun asked his father if he could use the company domain name, Terminal.com. Varun explained that he had plans for it, but this time there would be no need to carry hardware door to door. Today, Varun and his San Francisco-based team rent out browser-based virtual machines that they call Terminals to thousands of users across the globe giving them access to the infinite resources of the cloud. Users ranging from online education students to Dev-Ops professionals can now start, resize, and scale their own Terminals in a matter of seconds. Inside each Terminal, they discover an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and sharing programs. And they don’t even have to wait for them to be delivered to their door.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer, EdTech, Security, Software, Web Apps","San Francisco, California, United States",Terminal provides bleeding-edge software and AI to edtech companies looking to improve student success.,6120718,USD,6120718,2017-03-01,day,,240,19,27,6120718,USD,6120718,,,,6120718,USD,6120718,1,2016-07-14,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",$1M to $10M,,,,,Private,94107,2013-01-01,year,For Profit,https://www.terminal.com/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudlabs-inc-,,,"Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Education, Hardware, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software",4,"Danny Krause, Jeff Wu, Joseph Perla, Varun Ganapathi",11-50,M&A,Venture - Series Unknown,6120718,USD,6120718,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Was Acquired,"35,472","35,365",,1,,,,,,,,,,

Insig,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/insig,"In early 2015, we realized that there was a wealth of medical knowledge online but no intelligent interpretation or curation of it. We aimed to solve this by creating an Artificial Intelligence engine that could bring a patient to diagnosis based on their current medical state, symptoms and past medical history. In our pursuit we analyzed over 3 million patient records in engineering an AI model that could lead a naive patient right to diagnosis through simple questioning. Our algorithm became quite robust and reached nearly 80% accuracy. As we continued our research, meeting with more and more doctors, we found that the most immediately impactful application of our AI would come in automating medical documentation and administrative tasks slowing down practitioners. We decided to expand our focus from simply to diagnosis, to automating processes across the medical clinic. In everything we do, our goal is to help practitioners get back to what they do best ... medicine! Insig takes care of the rest! Why Remote Data Capture? Collecting patient information is absolutely critical in providing quality healthcare. Our intelligent questionnaire system automates the rendering of medical notes, the collection and organization of medical history, and rendering of any original paperwork/forms. Why Virtual Care?

Strossle,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sprinkle,"Strossle is a fast growing media tech company, helping publishers to optimize content distribution. We use machine learning technologies to adapt the user experience based on context and personal interests. It’s Artificial Intelligence for media. Strossle was founded in Sweden in 2013 by a team of entrepreneurs with an extensive media background. The shared perception was that the media industry was losing ground with its conservative view on technology and business models. Instead of embracing new distribution and business opportunities, media companies tried to lock users into their own channels and increase the amount of intrusive display ad formats that users had to sit through. Strossles mission is to help publishers out of this negative spiral and become future-proof. With Strossle publishers empower their content by: - Making sure every user is presented to an optimal mix of content - resulting in higher engagement. - Attracting new users through promotion of their best performing content in Strossle's publisher network. - Leveraging their premium environments by offering native advertisers extended reach. These values have clearly resonated with publishers. Since launch Strossle has had an average monthly growth rate of 20%, and now we're going global with our way of thinking.

DARC Technology can be used to measure the impact of current and future therapeutics and interventions by assessment of disease activity whilst identifying non-responders to existing and new interventions, resulting in the avoidance of costly, ineffective or un-required medical management. DARC helps to stratify patients in clinical trials, resulting in the creation of enriched patient cohorts, consisting of those at highest risk of rapid disease progression. DARC has been developed by Professor M Francesca Cordeiro at University College London through Wellcome Trust funding and is now approved as an exploratory biomarker by the FDA & MHRA.

Rainbird Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rainbird-technologies-ltd,"Poor decisions cost organisations billions yearly. Rainbird lets you build visual models of your smartest employees’ thought processes, then uses these models to automate decision making at rates typically 100x faster and 25% more accurate, with full explainability. Rainbird prevents billions being lost due to inconsistent, uninformed decision making. How does Rainbird automate complex decisions? 1. Capture expertise without coding Using a visual modeller, create knowledge maps of the thought processes applied by subject matter experts in any field. Knowledge maps aren’t linear (like decision trees in robotic process automation) or opaque (like machine learning models). This means you can productise expertise and make it available at scale. 2. Ask complex questions Pose questions or scenarios to Rainbird that align with the area of knowledge covered by your map. You can do this using conversational interfaces, APIs or other systems. Rainbird will provide answers with varying levels of certainty, even when dealing with ambiguity or incomplete data. This improves the accuracy of nuanced, multidimensional analyses, like fraud detection. 3. Get explanations for answers Ask Rainbird why it’s given you a particular answer and it will show an evidence tree of its reasoning, including all considered variables and the quantitative impact of each. This ensures you can comply with regulations and enjoy the full confidence of customers.

That’s why we offer a structured Learn Path alongside tailored practice plans, daily guitar workouts, a large song library, and interactive jam sessions.

Via an easy to use app linked to insole sensors, JOGO helps the football stars of tomorrow get noticed and supported. Trainers, scouts, and agents can optimize training, find that hidden gem, and create new opportunities for their players with our platform.  Imagine getting actionable insights on a player’s specific needs, based on 200 data points. Insights on acceleration, top speed, number of ball touches, leg distribution, shot speed, and much more. Not just plain data, but suggested actions that can help to improve on these improvement points.  Always. Player. Specific.  Even though football is the number one sport in the world, it falls behind when it comes to the usage of factual, objective data. In a tech-savvy world most training, coaching and scouting are still done purely based on plain, subjective data. Especially in youth football. Even in the best football academies, talented youth players are still developed in a conservative context.   However, data technology gets slowly more accepted. Just as the insight that youth development is key to a club’s success becomes more and more visible. With 3.000 pro and 600.000 amateur clubs, containing a total of 200.000.000 youth players, football needs an upgrade. JOGO allows the football community to do just that: use data to get better.

To produce knowledge based on data Archilyse uses four generic power-simulations, such as view, geometrical, connectivity and physical analysis, from which countless others can be derived. Their results provide the most comprehensive view on architecture currently available worldwide.  This is how it works: 2D floor plans in the form of PDFs or building image files are converted to 3D BIM-Light models and geo-referenced. Using API (Application Program Interface) calls, professional users can analyse building models drawn from algorithms which translated the latest scientific findings into formulas. The results are presented to users in easy-to-read heatmaps or can be exported in the form of key figure tables for further processing. This process renders portfolio digitalisation profitable for the first time.

Our flagship product, FxMammo, is an AI Assistant that significantly improves the screening procedure for mammograms by reducing the false positive rates by as much as 67% and enhancing the clinical workflow by reducing the time taken to assess a screen as well as the number of radiologists required per screen. Our algorithm was based off over 3 years of research at NUS and we have recently published on the prestigious AAAI Workshop and Jama Open Network Journal. We are also a portfolio company of the MedTech JUMPStart Program. FathomX’s unique AI Model for mammogram started out in a global competition - The Dream Challenge organised by the United States’ Whitehouse. As the top Asian team in the global competition that featured more than 100 participants from around the world, the founders decided to spin-off the company with the support of NUS Enterprise. From the time of the competition, the AI model has also progressed tremendously in its predictive accuracy, refinement and users’ preference are incorporated and continuously upgraded to meet differing and progressing needs. Within a year from incorporation, the company has secured several research collaborations with major hospitals including the National University Hospital and Kandang Kerbau Women and Children’s Hospital in Singapore, Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Japan and Taipei Medical University in Taiwan. On the commercialisation front, a co-investment and co-development deal with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) was signed that will see the company gain access to HPE’s engineering team as well as potential access to over 130 hospital clients in the APAC region. We have also executed a data transfer agreement with multiple research agencies like Lifepool (Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Australia). The company has also recently accepted SGD1.25 Million I2Start funding Pathway and is also one of the finalists of the prestigious MedTech Innovator competition in Singapore. FathomX has also been featured on multiple news media including Channel News Asia, Tamil Seithi, Channel 8 News, Enterprise SPARKS and TEDx.

It also requires a team to manage the interoperability of all the components of this entire infrastructure/technology stack. It takes years to get this stack together and a few more years to get it to provide the consumer insights and actions for it. This is usually only within consideration of large companies because of the significant investment in terms of capital both human and monetary.
