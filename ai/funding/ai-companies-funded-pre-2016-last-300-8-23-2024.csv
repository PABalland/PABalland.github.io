This is the problem opusomni is designed to solve. Opusomni translates book knowledge into lived experience, so people perform education, work, and health management tasks better.    Opusomni is a patented system, rooted in a broad body of evidence in the life sciences about what factors drive performance achievement in authentic environments. We bake that evidence into a mobile device form factor that is easy and fun to use whether you are seven or seventy.    The value proposition for our users is to: (1) facilitate the learner-mentor relationship to drive performance achievement in authentic learning environments; (2) generate meaningful, real-time informatics and analytics using machine learning of the data set to “sort the signal from the noise on the internet” to serve up content to help learners achieve their goals; and (3) stimulate sophisticated research through a massive, elegantly designed structured data set, evidence-based theoretical framework, and powerful learning system to examine and improve performance for our learners.    We have proof of concept through a year-long pilot study conducted at Washington University in St. Louis.    Did you know that 75% of all healthcare costs go to manage chronic diseases?    Yes, that’s right! Yet, today we have no way to effectively manage chronic diseases where people live their everyday lives.

Each article is individually ingested, and its sentiment assessed by natural language processing models. While the models aren't perfect, users can correct the sentiment rating produced by the system.  This crowd-sourcing technology allows the AI engine to constantly improve its accuracy. Mood measures how a stockâ€™s price responds to news. When a stock is in a good Mood that means the stock price responds very favorably to good news, and has a tendency to shrug off the bad news. The opposite is true for bad Mood. The more this happens the stronger the mood in that direction gets. When both the mood and the sentiment values for a stock reach certain empirically determined thresholds, a Sentiment Alert is issued, indicating a statistical probability for movement over the next 5 days. Sentiment alerts can be positive or negative. These Alerts  suggest that a stock may be at a peak of optimism or a peak of pessimism, respectively.  Our statistical analyses have shown that, at the time of an Overoptimism or Overpessimism Alert,  trading in the opposite direction of the news can provide significant edge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Ben Goertzel, Brett Markinson",1-10,1,Seed,2007-01-01,150000,USD,150000,Seed,150000,USD,150000,Seed,150000,USD,150000,150000,USD,150000,"Matt Coffin, Lagovent Ventures Group, LLC",,2

We'll bring you together and make sure you meet the right job or the right candidate. It's about time someone set out to do something different."" Wiseri is a job search platform which has a simple and sincere goal: to help as many people as possible find a job and to help businesses find the best candidates. The wiseri selection process ensures that candidates are only presented to companies where they have a good chance of being offered a job, and conversely, that companies are only presented with candidates with the skills and experience they are looking for. In November 2011, wiseri.com secured a round of investment worth 120,000 euros which was provided by 17 investors, all of whom are involved in the digital industries. Crucially for wiseri, this meant they brought to the company not only their money, but also their expertise and experience in the industry. In similar style to the way businesses in Silicon Valley secure seed capital, this investment round did not involve any outside investors or investment funds; but rather, the funds were provided by people who know and believe in what wiseri does. Furthermore, the round of investment was carried out from start to finish in a record time of 37 days and all communication between wiseri and its investors was conducted through email with complete transparency. On 14th January 2012, wiseri revealed a new side of its online platform, a system that sources talent from the crowd to form an expert selection team. In doing so, wiseri became the first company in the job search industry to incorporate gamification and crowdsourcing into its system. Members of the selection team are called Wisors and any job application made through wiseri.com first has to pass through the hands of a Wisor, who selects only those applications best matched to the job position and presents them to the company, taking care to give genuine and useful feedback to each candidate who didn't quite make it to ensure they have a better chance the next time round. And to make sure that the applications are checked by someone who knows what they're doing, only people who have already passed through the wiseri application system can go on to become Wisors; and once you are a Wisor, well, then you can enjoy a whole range of perks along the way, saving up wirees (wiseri's currency) as you go that you can cash in for a whole load of prizes.?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Gaming, Internet Services, Other, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Jorge Jimenez, Jose Angel Cano, Marina Zaliznyak",11-50,1,Seed,2011-11-01,120000,EUR,164075,Seed,120000,EUR,164075,Seed,120000,EUR,164075,120000,EUR,164075,,,

This formed the basis of the Gatfol technology currently in development and received an EMDA Innovation in Software award from the European Union in 2006. The rationale for the Gatfol pursuit is that, with all the work that has been done towards creating artificial intelligence in computers over many decades, it is still not possible to talk to computers on a human-to-human basis. While it is Gatfol's big vision to eventually enable humans to converse with data, a more immediate goal encompasses data search, because search is effectively talking to information.

Crowd developers are able to develop own apps for the car and B2B customers are able to use the interface to offer automotive near services (e.g. insurance, repair, reselling, gas, IRS, emergency services, etc.). Products/Services: Fully automated drivers log, fleet management, rental service, pre repair diagnostics, black box, odometer temper protection, eCall, contactless payment, etc. USP/Unique Technologies/Special Know-how: 5 pending patents lay the foundation of the IP. Beside that AI offers a solution that is capable of a complete car diagnostic and not only the OBD-II protocol as some competitors offer with a complete E2E roundtrip that no solution offers. Furthermore does the security concept and RESTful API provide a unique approach that is very positively received in presentations of the solution and its capabilities. Distribution: It is a highly scalable model as the technology is based on a global standard and therefore easily rolled out after translation of language files. The multi-tiered sales approach focuses in the first instance on direct sales to B2B (e.g. fleet management, logistics providers) in the second stage B2B2C is approached (e.g. insurance companies, automobile clubs) and in the final stage the rollout is taken to the B2C market (e.g. cheap gas pumping, CO2 challenges).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Mobile, Science and Engineering, Software, Transportation",2,"Alexander Marten, Stephan Kaufmann",11-50,3,Seed,2013-11-13,150000,USD,150000,Grant,1500000,EUR,1886612,Seed,2386612,USD,2386612,2536612,USD,2536612,"KfW, Seed Fonds Aachen, Alexander Marten",,3
