FIXER,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fixer-japan,"Aiming to be Japan's leading Cloud Service Vendor When we were founded in 2009, cloud computing was not an option for corporate system infrastructure. Seven years later, however, ""cloud first"" has become a concept that we take for granted. For the evolution of corporate activities and the future of people's livelihoods, it has become difficult to imagine a world without the cloud. In the IT industry, where mistakes are not tolerated, we have taken up the challenge of harnessing new technologies. This is not a simple matter, but we have been supported by our customers and partners, who have accompanied us on numerous challenges thus far, and we have grown to become Japan's number one enterprise for Microsoft Azure. Many system integration companies continue to operate with a mindset of simply taking a client's instructions and forcibly cobbling together a system, or passing the creator's risks onto the client. However, those of us who had our doubts came together, and FIXER was born and continues to grow. We will continue to evolve our core service, cloud.config, as well as return to society the services we create. This is our mission, which we call ""cloud integration.""

Bumper,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bumper-443f,"Bumper protects crypto assets against negative price movement when they are deposited by “Takers”, who are returned a tokenised version of the asset with the down-side volatility risk removed. The price risk is transferred to the opposing side of the market where “Makers” supply an alternative cryptocurrency that has a lower volatility; typically, a “stablecoin”. Both the protected asset and the stablecoin deposited by Takers and Makers are held by the protocol in pools. Stablecoins are at risk for the benefit of Takers in the event of certain negative price events, and Taker assets incur a variable premium in the native asset for the benefit of Makers. Both the volatile cryptocurrency and stablecoin pools are partially subordinated, allowing actors to engage with the protocol according to their individual perspective on future price behaviour of the protected asset. The Bumper design demonstrates how a decentralised software marketplace for asset price risk might prove superior to more traditional methods of using centralised stop-loss (which incurs slippage), or options markets (which has parasitic profits and overheads), by re-organising the utilities of the market participants.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Finance, Financial Services, FinTech","London, England, United Kingdom",BUMPER is a DeFi price protection protocol that protects the value of crypto assets.,10020000,USD,10020000,,,,,31,,10020000,USD,10020000,,,,20000,USD,20000,2,2021-10-12,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,"Alphabit Fund, Node Kapital, Chainlayer, Autonomy Capital, Beachhead Venture Capital",,,,Private,,2020-01-01,year,For Profit,https://bumper.fi,https://www.linkedin.com/company/bumperfinance/,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Other, Payments, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Gareth Ward, Jonathan DeCarteret",11-50,,Venture - Series Unknown,20000,USD,20000,Venture - Series Unknown,,6,,,"44,783","44,632",,,,,,,,,,,,

LOCI,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/loci-inc,"LOCI’s mission is to disrupt the global patent industry, and to change the way the world invents and values ideas. LOCIcoin utility tokens are used exclusively within the LOCI suite of products for the purposes of searching, analyzing, staking and exchanging Intellectual Property. LOCI Search provides a unique and patented Venn Diagram IP search tool for FREE (https://www.locisearch.com/) LOCI Invention Analysis helps new inventors determine the novelty and demand (undergoing further development) for their ideas before they spend money trying to patent. This is a huge cost savings of about 95% compared to traditional patent attorney searches. LOCI Invention Analysis can also help guide inventors toward “white space” where there are relatively few existing patents, where demand is high, so the inventor has the best possible chance of being awarded a patent, and/or selling their idea. Inventors can submit multiple iterations to help refine their idea and identify alternative applications of their invention. The ultimate goal of the inventor while using Invention Analysis is to achieve a optimal “LOCI Score” which indicates that their idea is unique, and in high demand. Once an inventor has refined their idea to feel confident that it is unique and in high demand, then they will be able to easily translate their idea into a provisional patent application using the LOCI system that is directly filed with the USPTO (in development), as well as stake their claim on the blockchain, which provides an immutable, undisputable time-stamp of the staked idea. This protects the invention for a period of 12 months at a very low cost.

Yap,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yap,"Yap pioneered the world's first high accuracy, automated speech recognition platform for ""long duration"" dialogues. Long duration dialogues are conversations and audio content ranging from 5 seconds to several hours. Yap specializes in accurately transcribing these dialogues for a variety of different scenarios including voicemail-to-text, conference call transcriptions, analysis of customer phone calls and voice-activated mobile messaging. The company was a TechCrunch finalist in 2007. Their management team previously worked on Apple's iPod, Honda's navigational systems, IBM's ViaVoice, Microsoft's Tellme speech division and Nuance's Dragon products. Yap white labels its SaaS platform -- i.e., Yap Speech Cloud(TM) -- to enable diverse use cases, including messaging, call analytics and voicemail-to-text. For example, Microsoft uses Yap for voice-based mobile messaging applications. Their end users can say anything they want to and have Yap's platform transcribe it into text (far more convenient than typing on the fumbling with a devices keypad while driving). MetroPCS also is a Yap customer. Cincinnati Bell, a regional carrier, uses Yap-based technology to convert subscriber voicemails into text. The carrier was a competitive win away from SpinVox (now Nuance). Part of the allure for Yap's service is that it's completely automated. That means there is no need for humans listening to messages, typing them out, and then sending them back out, giving Yap a real advantage in ensuring privacy. Because Yap is completely machine powered, the company is able to offer lower costs, higher speeds and greater consistency.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Audio, Messaging, Mobile, Speech Recognition, Telecommunications","Charlotte, North Carolina, United States","Yap pioneered a high accuracy, automated speech recognition platform for long duration dialogues.",10000000,USD,10000000,2011-09-08,day,0,,2,5,8000000,USD,8000000,,Computing; Calculating,,2000000,USD,2000000,3,2010-10-07,"East Coast, Southern US",,"Western Technology Investment, Harbert Management Corporation, Sunbridge Partners, Pittco Capital Partners, Timothy Biltz",,,1,Private,,2006-05-01,month,For Profit,http://www.yapme.com,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Music and Audio, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Igor Jablokov, Victor Jablokov",11-50,M&A,Debt Financing,6500000,USD,6500000,Series A,3,6,,Was Acquired,"318,153","308,905",,,,,,,,,,,,

Spotr.ai,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/octo,"With an ever-growing population, climate change, and growing compliance obligations globally, real estate is eager for better solutions. Spotr.ai monitors and inspects over 250.000 buildings in the Netherlands and recently launched in the UK with 10 prominent UK housing corporations that will start inspecting their real estate portfolios with Spotr’s software solution. Spotr.ai offers a platform for banks, insurance companies, large real-estate owners, and the government to monitor building characteristics in a fast, precise, and easily accessible platform. This contributes to optimizing their client’s portfolios and activities. “It’s about knowing and understanding your portfolio.” Says Dirk Huibers, CEO at Spotr.ai. “Think of the dimensions, quantities, and conditions of buildings and their specific components. This information is crucial to make smart decisions when achieving sustainability goals. But it’s also about asking yourself the basic questions. On which buildings can you place external wall insulation? How many floors does a building have? Can you still reach that high floor with a fire truck? Are there trees close to the gutters that could cause water damage? You need accurate data to make the right decisions for your portfolio and wallet. And that data simply doesn’t exist today.”  With only 8% of buildings currently being inspected every year due to budget and time constraints of building owners and facility managers, there’s much to gain. “It’s our ambition to inspect every building in the world every year,” says Huibers. “In the largest global sector in the world, a small deviation can have a major impact on maintenance costs and valuations. Our smart software can make better, faster, and cheaper budget estimations than humans alone, which makes us a reliable and trustworthy partner.”","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, Information Technology, Software","Den Haag, Zuid-Holland, The Netherlands","Inspects buildings automatically with Artificial Intelligence on satellites, airplanes, drones, cars and humans.",7000000,EUR,7917303,,,3,1,23,,7000000,EUR,7917303,,,Building; repairs,4500000,EUR,4885898,2,2024-01-23,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",$1M to $10M,"Volta Ventures, Concrete Venture Capital, InnovationQuarter, EDF Pulse Croissance",,,0,Private,2596,2015-01-01,year,For Profit,http://spotr.ai,https://www.linkedin.com/company/octo/,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Dirk Huibers, Marieke Dijksma, Tara Campagne",1-10,Early Stage Venture,Series A,4500000,EUR,4885898,Series A,2,4,,,"28,645","28,573",,,,,,,,,,,,

Saffron Technology,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/saffron-technology,"Saffron is the first artificially intelligent, cognitive computer that learns, reasons and anticipates like you and for you. Saffron fuses the power of computing with brain-like intelligence to help organizations quickly focus on the knowledge that matters most,   anticipate what will happen next, and optimize decisions based on this intelligence. Saffron’s Natural Intelligence Platform mimics our brain's ability to associate people, places and things at the entity level, learn how these entities are connected to every “thing” else, and the context behind these connections.   The platform ingests data from disparate sources and automatically connects the dots to illuminate the intelligence in large complex data sets. Every time new data arrives, Saffron learns its associations with existing memories to find new patterns, similarities, anomalies or sequences, revealing new information and enabling organizations to see specific events and patterns that otherwise would not have been detected. Saffron incrementally learns and adapts in real-time from new incoming data and human feedback. Saffron integrates with an organization’s existing analytics architecture to not only enhance the speed and volumes at which data can be converted to actionable knowledge, but also critically improve the accuracy of results. Our customers have applied the Natural Intelligence Platform to a number of operational risk intelligence solutions and decision support, including model-free fraud detection, personalized anticipatory maintenance, country risk assessment and personalized customer experience. With the advent of the Internet of Things and the avalanche of smart devices and sensors capturing data everywhere, Saffron’s Natural Intelligence platform is well poised to scale up to this massive data distribution and make every “thing” more intelligent.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Risk Management","Los Altos, California, United States","Saffron Technology offers research, financial, risk management, supply chain, security, healthcare, and social media services.",7540888,USD,7540888,2015-10-26,day,,,9,11,7540888,USD,7540888,,,,7000000,USD,7000000,4,2014-03-20,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",$1M to $10M,"Ullas Naik, Streamlined Ventures, USAA",,,,Private,94022,1999-01-01,year,For Profit,http://www.saffrontech.com,http://www.linkedin.com/company/saffron-technology,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Jim Fleming, Manuel Aparicio IV, Toufic Boubez",11-50,M&A,Series B,7000000,USD,7000000,Series B,1,3,,Was Acquired,"363,823","352,567",,,,,,,,,,,,

Panoratio,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/panoratio,"Panoratio was established in March, 2003, in Munich, Germany. The technology grew out of work started at the Siemens AG Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning Laboratory to address optimization issues regarding the installation and performance of gas turbine engines within Siemens Westinghouse power plants.   While sensors placed throughout the power plant generated extremely complex datasets, it proved impossible to close the performance loop and analyze them efficiently. Researchers solved this problem by developing of a pure software solution that reduces the dataset's footprint without losing any of its granularity or complexity. Recognizing the universal value of the solution, Siemens AG, established Panoratio as a separate, independent entity.   Since then, Panoratio has developed PANOsight, a software suite underpinned by the patented compression technology, and has over 50 customers in production. The company is proud to count AOK, AOL, Avis, buch.de, InsightHealth, KarstadtQuelle, Macy's, SavaSeniorCare, Sierra Health Services, Siemens, Sixt, Vodafone and Yahoo! among them.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, SaaS, Software","Munich, Bayern, Germany",Panoratio specializes in the investigative and predictive SaaS application based on large volumes of heterogeneous data.,7436322,USD,7436322,,,,,12,11,7436322,USD,7436322,,,,732000,USD,732000,4,2012-10-09,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",$1M to $10M,"Next47, Siemens Technology Accelerator, PolyTechnos Venture Partners, Deutsche Venture Capital, L-EigenkapitalAgentur",,,,Private,80336,2003-01-01,year,For Profit,https://www.panorat.io,http://www.linkedin.com/company/84542,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Michael Haft, Reimar Hofmann",11-50,,Venture - Series Unknown,732000,USD,732000,Venture - Series Unknown,,6,,,"372,189","360,586",,,,,,,,,,,,

You can also perform real-time recommendations to make consistent decisions that harness the collective intelligence of all the experts in your organization. Finally, their algorithms allow you to  predict the outcomes of future events and interactions.Their most important feature is that they focus on telling you the WHY of a prediction, this allows their algorithms to comply with the most stringent Artificial Intelligence auditing rules. simMachines specializes in bringing the power of Dynamic Predictive Segmentation (DPS) to the complex world of marketing technology. Today’s consumers expect marketers to personalize their messaging, content, and digital experiences, and to demonstrate relevance to their needs and interests. To do that efficiently, the marketer needs an in-depth understanding of what predictive factors drive consumer behavior. Machine learning can help, but most ML models are “black box.” simMachines takes a different approach, using their similarity-based methodology to explain the “WHY” behind every prediction in a fully transparent way. Imagine your marketing segmentation changing as often as your customers change their mind. With simMachines, more relevant, targeted, and predictive connections with customers are the result.  simMachines’ product portfolio includes verifyAI, a software platform for use in developing and visualizing dynamic predictive segmentation, and personifyAI, a web-based subscription that uses location-based mobile signal data to build behaviorally-based segmentation.
