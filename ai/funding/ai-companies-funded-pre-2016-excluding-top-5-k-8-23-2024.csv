The Totum Risk toolkit includes integrations with the top custodians, broker/dealers, insurance companies, and other third party software providers.  The integrations allow Totum to pull in the account level data to automatically score the clients portfolio and an advisors book of business to assess the portfolio risk.  Other integrations allow for SSO(single sign on), push/pull data from APIs, usage, and custom. Totum has added a Model MarketPlace for asset managers to add their models for advisors to use and compare with their client's portfolios.  Tactical asset managers can also add their own returns.  Advisors can add and uplaod their own models or use the iRebal integration to pull and push their models. Totum offers custom Investment Policy Statements and proposals to meet their compliance needs and requirements.  Totum helps advisors and institutions stay compliant by covering the SEC Best Interest Rule and FINRA's suitability rule. Built around the concept that each individual investor should fully understand their unique risk situation, Totum is the first to consider comprehensive Human Capital Factors in portfolio recommendation: geography, industry, health, family, balance sheet, and where they are on the road to retirement.  With the addition of Big Data and Machine Learning Totum can now alert an advisor or investor of a life event that is impacting their investments and financial goals.  This holistic context allows financial advisors to differentiate their proposals, targeting the specific risks that the client may not be aware of.

They tried that, and found it was almost, but not quite, good enough: in too many cases they had to drop down to custom code to get everything they needed, and that wiped out most of our productivity gains. Panamplify is taking a different approach: building systems that know enough about the domain being reported on to operate at a higher level of abstraction.

All participants in the Content Marketplace: Content Providers, Advertisers and Consumers have pains in the current system. Content Providers want to create enhanced engagement, know more about their viewers, deliver enhanced advertising and create simple, better Search Engine Optimization within their sites as well as in traditional Search Engines. Advertisers know there is an audience but they want to know the Articles, Images, Videos, Music and Products they are associated with fit all their marketing needs and do not create tensions. Consumers want a simple and easy experience that will also allow them to have a voice. Currently, there is too much unidentifiable or inappropriately labeled Articles, Images, Videos, Music and Product content on too many channels to properly make it all fit. Where and what is all this Big Data? 451 Degrees has created Graffiti, a Big Data software as a service (SaaS), that, without requiring any change to the original content, helps solve these issues and more. Graffiti follows content, whether it is an article, video, image, music or product, over multiple locations such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook plus others and analyzes all comments and info about that piece as an independent source and in symphony. Graffiti works with content publishers; news sites, video sites, image sites, product sites, blogs, e-commerce product sites and any one with comments or a desire to increase consumer engagement within their site. Big Data bringing Real Time results increasing revenues and relevance. Here’s how it works... Utilizing a simple bi-directional API, Graffiti analyzes large data sets so they can be used in a pro-active and revenue generating capacity to identify opportunities and strategies to better engage your consumer, deliver better advertising or product placement to your product and define all things properly. Graffiti is built to specifically analyze and redefine Internet content in REAL TIME by augmenting existing meta data with user generated comments. In short - Graffiti recognizes what is actually being said and its relevance by using patented Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) techniques. Most Articles, Images, Videos, Music Files or e-Commerce Products contain some original meta data placed on that content by the owners of that content. As a web based analytics tool and service, Graffiti will continually analyze these articles of content and update them with more relevant, truly organic, “meta tags” based on actual comments and what is really being talked about. These updates are automated in Real Time as new meta data. The content continues to evolve as the community Comments about it. This translates into the consumers ability to easily find the Articles, Images, Videos, Music Files and Products they seek. User commentary is better defined and assists the content owner with developing a true, instead of perceived or desired, set of tags originally placed by the content owner. What are the benefits to our Clients? Our core functionality allows our clients to analyze Big Data in Real Time, classify and redefine content by evaluating user comment based data generated through consumer engagement. This is no longer “junk” but the most useful element of any content. It is the audience of many brought into focus and use. The evaluation of Big Data, in the form of comments, in turn generates more true engagement which delivers stronger and more refined meta data to use when optimizing search (SEO) as well as Ad Delivery Networks (ADN) Key Word targets or Product Placement for every piece of content. Graffiti accomplishes this by collecting ALL comments available across the web and applying a proprietary algorithm to determine the most appropriate meta-tags and serving these refined meta-tags as a service in REAL TIME back to the original source. As well as to the Ad Delivery Network or Recommendation  Engine for increased transaction opportunity in Real Time. This Ad Delivery Network can exist as a stand alone Below The Fold (BTF) ADN thus creating and entire new frontier of revenue inside a barren wasteland. These are found revenues that are proven to be of the highest values in Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Action (CPA) transactions. Who Can Use Graffiti? Graffiti works with businesses that wants to make deep learning sense of comments and other consumer commentary and use it for engagement and revenue generation practices. Our target clients are Content Owners, Media, Consumer Brands, BioTech, e-Commerce and multi-national Corporations as well as strategic partners with existing technology solutions where we can provide added value to their offering.

Based on over 20 industry collaborations, it is very realistic to expect, at a minimum, CoRE™ can reduce preclinical attrition 5%, preclinical costs 20% and lead optimization costs 40%. When these three parameters were adjusted in a recent assessment of pharmaceutical R&D productivity (Paul et al. 2010 ) to capture the effects of using CoRE™, this translated to capitalized costs savings of $238 million and out-of-pocket cost reductions of $88 million.

Too many startups – include those of our founder – struggled forming enterprise partnerships. Startups spend too much precious time and money chasing corporate deals that don’t materialize.   Our beginning started with a simple hypothesis: would partnerships happen faster if they started with the corporate need; rather than the startup solution? To test the hypothesis, we gathered an incredible team of dedicated startup supporters to host an event. The format: large companies pitch innovation needs to an audience of startups – thereby switching the traditional pitching format. And so SwitchPitch began – initially as an event.   As the event format spread and gained popularity, corporates made it clear they needed an ongoing solution to identify and manage startup relationships. The SwitchPitch platform initially supported the projects / challenges presented at the event – enabling startups to apply to projects online.   Corporate usage increased and SwitchPitch expanding into an enterprise startup relationship management (SRM) platform. Along the way, we attracted an impressive group of investors, include Dreamit Ventures. Our vision is simple: corporate / startup partnership are the way all enterprises do business.   Today, innovation teams from top Fortune 500 companies use the platform’s proprietary startup database to scout startups, pipeline relationships, engage in pilot projects, and get deals done.

The unique CricViz computer model enables the prediction of match outcome, the interpretation of team and player performance and the anticipation of what is likely to happen next; cricket intelligence at the next level. WinViz probabilities are generated by CricViz’s unique computer model of Test cricket. This utilises a database of the last 500 Test matches played, using past and current data to estimate the probability of future events. The model uses the current state of the match, each player’s career history and characteristics of the venue and host country to simulate the remainder of the match. The simulations are run thousands of times, with the number of results that produce each match outcome converted into probabilities – if 4,000 out of 10,000 iterations result in a team winning, then that team has a 40% probability of winning. The PredictViz function outlines the most likely course the match will follow from its current position. The unique CricViz model of past and current data simulates the remainder of the game thousands of times, with the average predicted outcome for each team plotted across the game’s remaining timeline. The likeliest score and end point of each innings is predicted using the current state of the match, each player’s career history and characteristics of the venue and host country. PlayViz breaks down each team’s performance into its three basic aspects – batting, bowling and fielding. Each of those areas is given a positive or negative score in runs, measuring the performance of that team against that of an average Test team in the conditions present at that time. Team performances are compared to those of an average Test team, with adjustments taken into account for the pitch and opposition strength. The comprehensive historical database predicts the average performance of batsmen and bowlers in the position and role they are playing in. The PlayViz function measures performance relative to averages that take into account extra variables. Each team’s fielding performance is measured on the direct impact it has had on the score. Runs saved and missed are totalled for each player, with a dropped catch measured at the value of the wicket that was missed according to the model of projected scores. Fielding scores are adjusted by a system that rates the difficulty of a piece of fielding. BatViz gives a measure of how difficult batting has been in the last 30 minutes of play. It shows how hard it is for the batsmen to survive and score. The ball tracking data from every ball bowled in the match is compared to a database of over 300,000 Test deliveries. The balls in this database that are the most similar to the delivery being measured are evaluated in terms of wickets taken and runs conceded, with a game aggregate built to provide a metric of current batting difficulty at that time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Software, Sports",2,"Nathan Leamon, Phil Oliver",1-10,1,Seed,2015-10-20,,,,,,,Seed,Seed,,,,,,,"Seedrs, Venrex",1,2

Majority of these shoppers leave due to price considerations; so you can imagine the amount of money being left on the table! We help any online retailer that wants to increase customer retention & turn their inventory faster without giving one-size-fits all discounts. We do this by allowing online, automated price negotiation. FOSHO is a machine learning based API that retailers can embed on their site / chatbot and allow shoppers to negotiate. We all know what negotiation means, we have  certainly negotiated when we wanted a better salary or a cheaper car but, we have never experienced the ability to negotiate when we have shopped online! That’s the innovation of FOSHO. Users can negotiate on any product / service by making offers and our smart interface responds with instant, personalised counteroffers! A shopper can negotiate by making multiple offers within 2 minutes till FOSHO agrees on the price. Now shoppers don’t need to waste time on promo codes, cash back options or even waiting for sales seasons. And the online retailer is better off with more sales and happier customers. FOSHO is unique as it even gives you discounts to you in lieu of newsletter subscription, product reviews, waiving return rights, helping maintain retailer’s ROI and other customisable options – which has never been done before!    Fosho does this though its unique negotiation algorithm, which takes pre-defined rules from vendors and then optimises for various parameters real time. The shopper can thus 'negotiate' for price at point-of-sale.  This technology allows vendors to increase their profits without giving the same, flat discount to all.  Its a more efficient way of economic optimisation!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Software",2,"Khyati Sundaram, Pratyush Lal",1-10,1,Seed,2015-11-01,16000,USD,16000,16000,USD,16000,Seed,Seed,16000,USD,16000,16000,USD,16000,,,

The focus of our work is on developing conversational interfaces based on artificial intelligence that enable companies to automate customer communication. The Chatbot Solution called moinAI is a SaaS-Product developed by knowhere. moinAI is a self-learning AI chatbot solution for digital customer communication of companies. No matter if marketing, sales or customer service - moinAI is the automation solution that helps to react quickly and efficiently to customer requests around the clock. Depending on the use case, this results in benefits such as increased customer satisfaction, more automated leads, an increased conversion rate and a reduction in support volume.    Numerous companies from various industries have already optimized their customer communication with moinAI. These include Geberit, Velux, Abus, Der Spiegel and Dräger. The bandwidth of use cases ranges from first level support to marketing campaigns up to e-commerce strategies and many more. However, one thing is true for each of the above-mentioned use cases: the impressive KPIs resulting from automation.    What makes moinAI so special is its ability to learn on its own. The so-called self-learning works by means of several AI-principles and ensures that moinAI is a self-runner in the truest sense of the word. Once the AI chatbot has been trained by us and implemented at the respective company, no further and costly training sessions on the part of the company are required. In addition, the language understanding is Natural-Language-Processing-based (NLP-based), which means that the AI does not understand user queries on the basis of keywords, but instead identifies semantic relationships, which makes it possible to understand long and complicated sentences. Through NLP and AI, moinAI therefore understands even complex messages and learns independently with each user conversation. Thus moinAI offers a system that grows with the needs and requirements of the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Sales and Marketing, Science and Engineering, Software",5,"Florian Nommensen, Markus Bröcker, Patrick Zimmermann, Robert Weber, Sebastian Schmitt",11-50,1,,2015-09-01,,,,,,,Non-equity Assistance,,,,,,,,SpinLab - The HHL Accelerator,,1

Saffron’s Natural Intelligence Platform mimics our brain's ability to associate people, places and things at the entity level, learn how these entities are connected to every “thing” else, and the context behind these connections.   The platform ingests data from disparate sources and automatically connects the dots to illuminate the intelligence in large complex data sets. Every time new data arrives, Saffron learns its associations with existing memories to find new patterns, similarities, anomalies or sequences, revealing new information and enabling organizations to see specific events and patterns that otherwise would not have been detected. Saffron incrementally learns and adapts in real-time from new incoming data and human feedback. Saffron integrates with an organization’s existing analytics architecture to not only enhance the speed and volumes at which data can be converted to actionable knowledge, but also critically improve the accuracy of results. Our customers have applied the Natural Intelligence Platform to a number of operational risk intelligence solutions and decision support, including model-free fraud detection, personalized anticipatory maintenance, country risk assessment and personalized customer experience.

The technology grew out of work started at the Siemens AG Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning Laboratory to address optimization issues regarding the installation and performance of gas turbine engines within Siemens Westinghouse power plants.   While sensors placed throughout the power plant generated extremely complex datasets, it proved impossible to close the performance loop and analyze them efficiently. Researchers solved this problem by developing of a pure software solution that reduces the dataset's footprint without losing any of its granularity or complexity. Recognizing the universal value of the solution, Siemens AG, established Panoratio as a separate, independent entity.   Since then, Panoratio has developed PANOsight, a software suite underpinned by the patented compression technology, and has over 50 customers in production.

Users can then see each blog post, video or image that has to do with the brand, and the interface shows how mentions increase and decrease over time. What sets Scout Labs apart is their ability to analyze each blog post. Their software decides if it is negative, positive or neutral towards the brand. They are also able to rank the source of the content to highlight more influential sources.

Long duration dialogues are conversations and audio content ranging from 5 seconds to several hours. Yap specializes in accurately transcribing these dialogues for a variety of different scenarios including voicemail-to-text, conference call transcriptions, analysis of customer phone calls and voice-activated mobile messaging. The company was a TechCrunch finalist in 2007. Their management team previously worked on Apple's iPod, Honda's navigational systems, IBM's ViaVoice, Microsoft's Tellme speech division and Nuance's Dragon products. Yap white labels its SaaS platform -- i.e., Yap Speech Cloud(TM) -- to enable diverse use cases, including messaging, call analytics and voicemail-to-text. For example, Microsoft uses Yap for voice-based mobile messaging applications. Their end users can say anything they want to and have Yap's platform transcribe it into text (far more convenient than typing on the fumbling with a devices keypad while driving). MetroPCS also is a Yap customer. Cincinnati Bell, a regional carrier, uses Yap-based technology to convert subscriber voicemails into text. The carrier was a competitive win away from SpinVox (now Nuance). Part of the allure for Yap's service is that it's completely automated. That means there is no need for humans listening to messages, typing them out, and then sending them back out, giving Yap a real advantage in ensuring privacy.

Their humble beginnings can be traced back to eight rooms globally as the company started off with a virtual team (a great story over a drink someday!) and their first office was in a warehouse in Singapore (since it’s hard to find garages). Like most companies starting out, they had long delivery nights with pizzas and Cola, but they also had fun. Like most companies, they also struggled initially but were determined. Our metamorphosis into a company with operations in seven countries has been predominantly through word-of-mouth by clients and employees who are enthralled by their work. As the complexity in their daily life increases, they yearn for simplicity. The products that have changed lives have a common underlying theme – simplicity; for simplicity reduces stress and increases happiness in their lives. At Einsights, simplicity is deeply engrained in their DNA and is reflected in everything from product design to the user experience. Our mission is to democratise data and to simplify the corporate decision making process. They are creating a product that is beautiful yet powerful.

Most companies either have a very good R&D team who struggles to stay engaged as more and more of their job is maintenance and not invention; or, they are on their 2nd/3rd/4th even version of their first data scientist (some can't even find one) who starts off well, but leaves taking all their institutional knowledge with them.  What's wrong and why this is happening goes back to the idea that data science is just another type of employee; data-driven decision making another strategy to implement.  This is not the case.  CAN has been around since the beginning. Before the term data science. Before the term Big Data. Before the term predictive analytics. We started as economists doing econometrics.  What we have seen over the last 11 years, and what we have discovered, is that data science (know by us as data-driven decision making) is a complete overhaul of philosophy of a company and a completely new type of employee.  This isn't easily implementable and it isn't done well by anyone we have seen.  But why? Because companies have been lying to themselves. Especially those that are pre-internet. They say they use data (they don't). They say they are proactive (they aren't). All software and tech really has really done, when you pull the covers back, is make the same processes companies were doing in the 70's, faster. That's right. Companies have changed nearly nothing and its starting to show.  CAN was invented to help companies transition from reactive (making plans based on what happened last week, last month, and last year) to proactive. Looking at your data, looking at the trends, and making decisions based on what the data is telling actually you is extremely hard.  You see you cant innovate internally. I know many have tried and a few outliers have succeeded. But the vast majority of companies cannot just hire a senior data scientist and expect them to lead the change. Its a recipe for disaster we have seen many, many times.  So we went and invented the right way to implement data science into an organization where it will work, flourish, grow, and in the end be owned by the company where it can be successful.  We cracked the code.  It's not easy and it's certainly not a short road. True paradigm shift never is. But, with a partner like CAN, true change management from reative to data-driven decision making is possible. We have seen it, done it, and currently doing it.

Carl Jung was a pioneering psychologist in the development of the concept of psychological or personality typing. The concept of psychological or personality typing was then expanded on by Isabel Briggs Myers with the creation of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Personality psychology is a branch of psychology in academia. IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER The business landscape has changed. Customers are not only more difficult to acquire, keep, and grow, but also much harder to please, engage, connect, communicate, and build relationship with than ever before. Customers also own the relationship—not the company. Business success today requires a new depth of customer insight—an insight that is beyond any demographic, buyer, interest, financial, and lifestyle data. That insight is personality. Personality is the root of all behaviors, feelings, attitudes, desires, and needs. Personality is the piece that makes us unique. You use personality information to engage, connect, communicate, sell, and build relationship with customers.

Except for the most routine cases, hunting for these insights requires grappling with complex, difficult-to-learn interfaces or tedious programming. Questions about data that take moments to formulate can take hours or much longer to answer. SkyPhrase aims to change this. With SkyPhrase, you can pose a question in simple natural language, and our artificial intelligence technology will figure out what you mean, and how to answer. Our goal is to make it easy to use all data this simply. Our web analytics and football statistics services are early steps towards achieving this goal. At SkyPhrase, our approach to natural language understanding is different because of our goals and because of our technology. We focus on giving people significantly more power over their data in specific areas, and allowing developers to easily add support to other areas. Within these areas, our technology can understand significantly more complex language with greater precision than any other technology. While we currently only cover web analytics and football statistics, our technology makes it extremely simple and easy for developers with little knowledge of linguistics or artificial intelligence to create natural language interfaces to their own data and applications. Our technology has been developed by scientists with decades of experience in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics research at institutions such as MIT, Stanford and Rensselaer.

DwellAware solves this problem by helping these businesses predict the risks and reduce their costs. We do this by digitizing critical, but previously non-existent information about homes and neighborhoods.  We then analyze this proprietary information to identify and predict the unique risks for their business and their customers. Our insights significantly reduce the information asymmetry that currently exists for these businesses and their customers, and allow them to make better financial and risk assessments in advance of a business or purchase decision.
