OpenAI,"OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization founded in December 2015, researching artificial intelligence with the goal of developing ""safe and beneficial"" artificial general intelligence, which it defines as ""highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work."" As one of the leading organizations of the AI boom, it has developed several large language models, advanced image generation models, and previously, released open-source models. Its release of ChatGPT has been credited with starting the AI boom. The organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. registered in Delaware and its for-profit subsidiary OpenAI Global, LLC. It was founded by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk serving as the initial Board of Directors members. Microsoft provided OpenAI Global, LLC with a $1 billion investment in 2019 and a $10 billion investment in 2023, with a significant portion of the investment in the form of computational resources on Microsoft's Azure cloud service. On November 17, 2023, the board removed Altman as CEO, while Brockman was removed as chairman and then resigned as president. Four days later, both returned after negotiations with the board, and most of the board members resigned. The new initial board included former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor as chairman.

VisLab," VisLab is an Italian company working on computer vision and environmental perception for vehicular applications. It was founded in the early 90s as a research laboratory at University of Parma. It started its activities in 1990, with its involvement in the Eureka PROMETHEUS Project. Since then the research group has focused on vehicular applications. VisLab, directed by Alberto Broggi, undertakes basic and applied research, including the perception of the surrounding environment in vehicular applications using cameras and fusion with other sensors. Its researchers contribute to fields such as artificial vision, image processing, machine learning, neural networks, robotics, and sensor fusion. In 2009, eleven VisLab researchers started a spinoff company, named VisLab srl, to commercialize the results of their main researches. The University of Parma owned a share of 5%. In 2015, VisLab was acquired by Silicon Valley company Ambarella Inc., and about 30 researchers asked and then were hired by VisLab to staff their new Parma location.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisLab,"{'name': 'Artificial Vision and Intelligent Systems Lab', 'established': '1996 (initiated 1990)', 'city': 'Parma', 'country': 'Italy', 'administrative_staff': 26, 'website': 'http://www.vislab.it/ www.vislab.it', 'logo': 'Image:VisLab Logo.png|center|256px|VisLab Logo'}",http://www.vislab.it/ www.vislab.it,1996 (initiated 1990),,,,
Google DeepMind,"DeepMind Technologies Limited, doing business as Google DeepMind, is a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory which serves as a subsidiary of Google. Founded in the UK in 2010, it was acquired by Google in 2014 and merged with Google AI's Google Brain division to become Google DeepMind in April 2023. The company is based in London, with research centres in Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines, resulting in a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain. Google DeepMind has created neural network models to play video games and board games. It made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol, a world champion, in a five-game match, which was the subject of a documentary film. A more general program, AlphaZero, beat the most powerful programs playing go, chess and shogi after a few days of play against itself using reinforcement learning. In 2020, DeepMind made significant advances in the problem of protein folding with AlphaFold. In July 2022, it was announced that over 200 million predicted protein structures, representing virtually all known proteins, would be released on the AlphaFold database. AlphaFold's database of predictions achieved state of the art records on benchmark tests for protein folding algorithms, although each individual prediction still requires confirmation by experimental tests. AlphaFold3 was released in May 2024, making structural predictions for the interaction of proteins with various molecules. It achieved new standards on various benchmarks, raising the state of the art accuracies from 28 and 52 percent to 65 and 76 percent.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_DeepMind,"{'name': 'DeepMind Technologies Limited', 'logo': 'DeepMind new logo.svg', 'logo_size': '250px', 'image': 'DeepMind headquarters S2 Handyside.jpg', 'image_size': '250px', 'image_caption': 'Headquarters in Kings Cross, London', 'trading_name': 'Google DeepMind', 'founded': '2010-09-23', 'location': 'London, England', 'founders': ['Demis Hassabis', 'Shane Legg', 'Mustafa Suleyman'], 'key_people': ['Demis Hassabis (chief executive officer)', 'Lila Ibrahim (chief operating officer)'], 'industry': 'Artificial intelligence', 'parent': 'Deepmind Holdings Limited', 'type': 'Subsidiary', 'owner': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'num_employees': '2,500+ (2024)', 'products': ['AlphaGo', 'AlphaStar', 'AlphaFold', 'AlphaZero'], 'website': 'https://deepmind.google/'}",https://deepmind.google/,9/23/2010,,"['Demis Hassabis', 'Shane Legg', 'Mustafa Suleyman']",Artificial intelligence,"2,500+ (2024)"
