	- We generate data in json files on dropbox
	- Carlos connects that to the website
		○ If space becomes sparse, he creates a database
	- Build something in the next 2 weeks in ceps.ai/dev
	- Draft skeleton at the end of June (first draft)
	- February 25: Private launch
	- Then get it ready for March 25
	- Andrea, (Laura, Cinzia) give feedback on content
		○ At this stage map the current observatories out there
	- Integrate FoW unclear yet
	- Structure: profiles and sections
		○ Geography
		○ Application & tasks, alternatively go directly to sectors like in the UNIDO project
		○ Compute could be its own atlas, but great to have it
	- Can it lead to deep dives?
		○ Yes, can stay high-level
		○ Microsoft question: where to put data center for clean energy?
	- So we start with places & sectors
	
	- Data as disaggregated as possible
	- What are the use cases that we map?
	- Ask potential users: what do you want to see?
		○ Startupper, bigtecher, researcher, commissioner
		○ Which places area leading?
		○ What type of AI?
		○ What does the ecosystem look like?
	- People like to see rankings - another type of page next to places and profiles & from ranking go to profile
	- Structure is scalable, new profiles additive
	- Security needs to be good
	- Feedback side event at Ideas Lab
	- Danae needs access to the feedback
Carlos + Danae connected bilaterally on design
