They approached numerous high-street banks and kept getting variations of the same response – “the computer says ‘No’”. Despite being a profitable business with strong cash flow and retained clients, none of the commercial banks were willing to lend to them. It was too small a ticket to offset the costs the bank would incur in doing a fundamental assessment of their business and structuring a finance facility for their needs. A few months later through one of their institutional client’s special situations desk, they managed to secure 100x the amount of debt for a dividend recap. So, an institutional division of a bank was able to support them, but the commercial lending part of the bank was not.     This experience stuck with them.     After they’d scaled Copal Partners to a 3,000-employee business and sold it to Moody’s Corporation (NYSE: MCO) in 2014, they set out to address the funding gap they had experienced first-hand and empower the Missing Middle, through launching OakNorth Credit Intelligence (ONci).     ONci's ON Credit Intelligence Suite transforms commercial lending by helping banks build deeper relationships with their clients, open new, more profitable opportunities, whilst delivering credit decisions up to ten times faster than traditional models, with lower risk and greater efficiency.    Credit Intelligence is a data-driven technology that gives lenders a forward-looking view of the borrower based on expansive and dynamic data sets and scenarios specific to that business, using automated, continuous analysis of multiple drivers across the business, its peer group and the wider economy. This provides an independent, consistent, detailed framework offering deep contextual insight that enables rapid underwriting, immediate stress-testing and more agile and targeted strategic lending.    Built over five years by an engineering and credit science team of over 250 people, the ON Credit Intelligence Suite has propelled OakNorth Bank in the UK into the top 1% of banks in developed markets in terms of RORE and efficiency, enabling it to profitably manage a multi-billion-dollar commercial lending portfolio - benefits that banks across the world can now realize.     In addition to OakNorth’s own bank in the UK, the software is also being deployed by banks around the world, including: SMBC, PNC Bank, Customers Bank, Old National Bank and Modern Bank in the US, and NIBC and OIMIO in Europe.","Total.Funding.Amount":1041034147,"Total.Funding.Amount.Currency":"USD","Total.Funding.Amount.Currency..in.USD.":1041034147,"Founded.Date":"2015-01-01","Founded.Date.Precision":"year","Top.5.Investors":"GIC, Indiabulls Housing Finance, EDBI, SoftBank Vision Fund, Clermont Group","IPqwery...Patents.Granted":0,"city":"London","region":" England","country":"United Kingdom","parent":"Europe +","color":"#669999","value":1041034147,"id":"OakNorth Credit Intelligence"},{"Organization.Name":"Trax","Organization.Name.URL":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/traxretail","Headquarters.Location":"Singapore, Central Region, Singapore","Description":"Trax provides in-store execution tools, market measurement services, and data science solutions for retail.","CB.Rank..Organization.":"2,782","Full.Description":"Trax provides offers in-store execution tools, market measurement services, and data science solutions for retail.

Unlearn invented their TwinRCT solution to enable biopharma partners to run faster, more successful clinical trials. A TwinRCT is a randomized trial that uses machine learning to achieve a higher probability of success with a smaller number of patients. As in a traditional RCT, patients are randomized to a treatment group and a control group, but, unlike a traditional trial, a prognostic digital twin is created for every patient using a machine learning model trained on historical data. The treatment effects for the primary and secondary outcomes can all be estimated from the trial with greater precision after correcting for a prognostic score derived for each patient's digital twin. TwinRCTs provide a scientifically-sound method for using deep learning and historical patient data to improve clinical trials.","Total.Funding.Amount":84850000,"Total.Funding.Amount.Currency":"USD","Total.Funding.Amount.Currency..in.USD.":84850000,"Founded.Date":"2017-01-01","Founded.Date.Precision":"year","Top.5.Investors":"8VC, Alumni Ventures, Insight Partners, DCVC, Parkway Venture Capital","IPqwery...Patents.Granted":6,"G2.Stack...Total.Products.Active":19,"city":"San Francisco","region":" California","country":"United States","parent":"United States","color":"#8cab79","value":84850000,"id":"Unlearn.AI"},{"Organization.Name":"NextVPU","Organization.Name.URL":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nextvpu","Headquarters.Location":"Shanghai, Shanghai, China","Description":"NextVPU offers embedded AI solutions for most of the smart devices and applications.","CB.Rank..Organization.":"15,492","Full.Description":"NextVPU refers to “Next Vision Processing Unit”, They are dedicated to offer embedded AI solutions for most of the smart devices and applications, power these intelligent devices with vision and brain, extensively apply to robots, UAV, UGV, security monitoring, etc. They also R&D “AngelEye”, the world’s first smart glasses to assist blind people perceiving the world and travelling safely.","Total.Funding.Amount":600000000,"Total.Funding.Amount.Currency":"CNY","Total.Funding.Amount.Currency..in.USD.":84831669,"Founded.Date":"2016-01-01","Founded.Date.Precision":"year","Top.5.Investors":"WestSummit Capital, Frees Fund, ICBC International, Changjin Holdings Industrial Capital, CETHIK","IPqwery...Patents.Granted":55,"city":"Shanghai","region":" Shanghai","country":"China","parent":"China","color":"#365a94","value":84831669,"id":"NextVPU"},{"Organization.Name":"Sama","Organization.Name.URL":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/samasource","Headquarters.Location":"San Francisco, California, United States","Description":"Sama is a training data partner trusted by organizations to develop accurate artificial intelligence and machine learning models.","CB.Rank..Organization.":"1,398","Full.Description":"Sama is a globally recognized leader in data annotation solutions for enterprise AI models that require the highest accuracy.

Autonomous buildings are the key to addressing this energy challenge and unlocking the future of cities. PassiveLogic’s autonomous building platform, powered by Quantum - the physics-based digital twin standard for autonomous systems, has proven 30% energy savings compared to conventional control systems. Applying this scalable technology across the entire U.S. building sector alone creates a net savings opportunity of 9.6 Quads per year—the equivalent of taking 1/3 of all U.S. vehicles off the road.

The Lytics Customer Data Platform (CDP), the company's flagship product, was launched in October 2014. The Lytics CDP connects a company's marketing data about customers and users from multiple sources (e.g., structured and unstructured data from tools, anonymous and known profiles, and other interactions and events from the marketing stack, sales, and support databases) and creates behavior-rich user-profiles and segments (e.g., likely to churn, most active on mobile, coupon lover). These customer profiles and segments then sync with a company's marketing tools (from website personalization and ad retargeting, to email marketing and content optimization) to improve marketing campaign results and reduce inefficiencies. Many marketing technology vendors claim to offer a \"customer data platform.\" Lytics has the only customer data platform that is easy enough for a beginner marketer to use, but technically sophisticated enough to impress software developers and data scientists. Lytics builds a profile based on unifying any fragment of customer information using sophisticated data science and conducts probabilistic matching to merge identities. The result: a rich profile of a consumer that can power one-to-one marketing in third-party martech tools, APIs, and Lytics own native execution platform.
