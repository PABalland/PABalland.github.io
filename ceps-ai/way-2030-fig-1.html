Figure 1: The rise of far-right movements in the European Parliament. This figure presents data on political groups often categorized as 'far-right', along with a breakdown of non-affiliated groups into national-level political parties that are also often classified under this label. It’s important to note that there is ongoing debate among political scientists regarding these classifications, and exact figures may vary depending on the criteria used. While the specific numbers should be interpreted with caution, Figure 1’s overall trend aligns with general observations.
