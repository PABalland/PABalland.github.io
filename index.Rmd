Pierre-Alexandre Balland is a [French economist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORZg_McAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) specialized in the fields of economic geography, economics of innovation, network science, and applied artificial intelligence. 

Pierre-Alexandre is a [Professor of Economic Geography](https://www.uu.nl/staff/PMABalland/Profile) and research fellow at the [Center for Complex Systems Studies](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/centre-for-complex-systems-studies-ccss) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en). He previously held positions at [MIT](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/balland/overview/), [The University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) and [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/). He currently serves in the [ESIR](https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/support-policy-making/support-eu-research-and-innovation-policy-making/esir_en) expert group that advises the European Commission on innovation policy.  

Balland analyzes economic development from a [complex systems perspective](https://www.paballand.com/writing). The economy grows when humans become more connected. New technologies and globalization allow for a deeper division of knowledge that makes our species a giant team joining forces to produce new ideas and products. This is the long story of trade and division of labor and this is an unbelievably efficient way to organize the economy. But there is a catch. This division of knowledge creates room for hierarchy and inequality. Complexity makes key resources very, very [concentrated](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0803-3) (hello network effects). Increased interdependencies make us more vulnerable to [pandemics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0YMLBT16n4), financial, and ecological crises. This is the real system failure that justifies policy intervention. Complexity puts a big pie on the table, institutions give a chance to everyone who baked to eat a piece. 

To navigate this complex world, Balland makes use of complex systems heuristics, network science and AI techniques. With his team, Balland also develops his own [frameworks](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00343404.2018.1437900), [large datasets](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/BPC15W), [software](https://rdrr.io/github/PABalland/EconGeo/) and recommendation systems. He believes that the best way for a scholar to understand this complex world is to escape his office and interact with it as much as possible. This applied activities range from helping helped policymakers and companies in their digital transition, investment choices, and several other key decision-making processes.
