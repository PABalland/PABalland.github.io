I am an Assistant Professor of Economic Geography at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en),  and research fellow at the [Center for Complex Systems Studies](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/centre-for-complex-systems-studies-ccss). I previously held positions at [MIT](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/balland/overview/), UCLA, and Lund University. 

I am an economist by training, and I try to understand why some parts of the world are rich, other poor, and what we can do about it. On a more applied side, I work with policymakers and companies to solve real-world problems using network analysis and complex systems thinking. 

On this website, you'll find data, codes, journal articles, and news about my team and my research.
