This proprietary, in vitro diagnostic format provides a colorimetric readout in minutes, visual to the naked eye, without the need for any reagents, readers, instruments, equipment, or training, providing truly decentralized testing that can enable clinicians to extend the point-of-care and laypeople to self-administer at the point-of-need. Our diagnostics combine highly selective molecular receptors with colorimetric nanomaterial reporters to provide immediate, actionable diagnosis to radically improve patient treatments and outcomes, while greatly reducing costs. Under a grant from the NIH, Chemeleon developed this diagnostic to detect the protein biomarker, beta-2-transferrin, in order to enable healthcare practitioners to immediately identify and treat Cerebrospinal Fluid leaks in surgical, post-op, and clinical settings which leads to a drastic decrease in morbidity (87% reduction in meningitis), length of patient stay (by up to a week) and healthcare costs (around $16,000 per patient). Providing the same level of specificity and selectivity as lab-based tests, but in minutes (not days) with a hand-held, instrument-free diagnostic at a fraction of the cost means that this rapid, simple, and inexpensive diagnostic can revolutionize healthcare from hospitals to resource-deprived regions.

To solve this problem, STAR'S TECH developed and commercialized the world's first eco-friendly de-icing agent using starfish extract. This unique solution provides superior results when compared with other traditional de-icing methods. ECO-ST1 is an eco-friendly de-icing agent made from sea waste starfish. It is developed by researchers at Seoul National University and helps reduce the overhead costs of deicing by up to 90%. 80% of the cost of de-icing is overhead. ECO-ST1 prevents traffic accidents through rapid and continuous melting and minimizes iron corrosion and concrete damage to minimize the cost of repairing roads, bridges, vehicles, and guard rails. It also solves road damage by minimizing plant sulfurization. STAR'S TECH has developed an innovative technology to extract the porous structures from starfish. Unstable chloride ions resulting from deicing are absorbed by these porous structures through electrostatic force. Starfish extract helps control chloride ion concentration, which can otherwise be detrimental to the environment. This technology also enables corrosion inhibitor reaction by using very few anti-corrosion agents. ECO-ST1 is manufactured in a bead form rather than the commonly used flake form. This bead is coated with starfish extract and a diffuser for de-icing. Beads are advantageous because they have greater penetration and de-icing performance. Also, as this starfish-coated bead does not create dust, it does not cause respiratory problems.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Dyes; Paints; Polishes; Natural Resins; Adhesives; Miscellaneous Compositions; Miscellaneous Applications Of Materials","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Chemical substances","sharen":2.7,"shareusd":0.57,"country":"South Korea","region":"Seoul-t'ukpyolsi","city":"Seoul"},{"id":"ProPhos Chemicals","value":1913637,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Chemical, Chemical Engineering, Industrial","HeadquartersLocation":"Rome, Lazio, Italy","FullDescription":"ProPhos is a green chemical company based in Italy that produces fire extinguishing powder and other dry chemical powder for all classes of fire.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Foods Or Foodstuffs; Their Treatment, Not Covered By Other Classes","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Chemical substances","sharen":2.7,"shareusd":0.57,"country":"Italy","region":"Lazio","city":"Rome"},{"id":"Diatomix","value":1897050,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Chemical, CleanTech, Nanotechnology","HeadquartersLocation":"Beaverton, Oregon, United States","FullDescription":"Diatomix is an air-purifying technology company that offers an all-inclusive OEM air-purifying additive.

Kintech Lab is also system integrator and provides ready solutions in the field of informational computational infrastructure for research and educational organizations. The traditional approach to the creation of new materials and technologies based on prototype development followed by the introduction of modifications into the prototype after its testing is time-consuming and expensive. In this approach, simulation is in many cases used to describe the experimental data obtained and to extrapolate these data using particular model approximation. In this case, the researcher must not understand the detailed mechanism of the process at the atomic level. Therefore, he or she cannot utilize abundant information on the properties of materials and processes gained in fundamental scientific research. Progress in theoretical methods, the development of efficient computational algorithms, the continuous exponential growth of computer resources and recent advances in massively parallel computing have made possible an alternative approach. This approach implies an a priori simulation of materials’ properties and processes based on the detailed understanding of the structure and mechanisms at the atomic level. In this approach, simulation precedes prototype development, which significantly reduces the number of experimental tests and, hence, development cost and time and innovation risks.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":2.7,"shareusd":0.57,"country":"Russian Federation","region":"Moscow City","city":"Moscow"},{"id":"West Virginia Regional Technology Park Corp.","value":886762,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Biotechnology, Chemical, Child Care","HeadquartersLocation":"Charleston, West Virginia, United States","FullDescription":"West Virginia Regional Technology Park Corp. is a premier research and technology facility and a global leader in research and innovation.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":2.7,"shareusd":0.57,"country":"United States","region":"West Virginia","city":"Charleston"},{"id":"BEN & GAWS","value":884338,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Chemical, Fuel, Industrial, Water","HeadquartersLocation":"New Delhi, Delhi, India","FullDescription":"BEN & GAWS is like food grain and other industrial solid, water, fuel company& other industrial liquid storage to support generations for hundred years.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":2.7,"shareusd":0.57,"country":"India","region":"Delhi","city":"New Delhi"},{"id":"Biopetrolia","value":883392,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Biotechnology, Chemical, Health Care, Sustainability","HeadquartersLocation":"Göteborg, Vastra Gotaland, Sweden","FullDescription":"Biopetrolia is a biotechnology company that specializes in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering of yeast cell factories.

Lambda’s paint converts unused sunlight to light used for photosynthesis by plants, leading to more crop, sweeter produce and boosting sales by circa £25k per acre per Grower. Sunlight doesn’t have enough red to drive photosynthesis optimally. Today, the proportion of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for plants, i.e. red light, is increased via artificial lighting - but electricity is costly. Our diffusive, red emitting spray paint for greenhouse sidings (panels) requires no electricity and can increase crop yields by circa 9%, as shown by our independently verified 40m2 field trial at Cranfield University. Lambda has filed a patent for the active chemical responsible for the light conversion from higher energy light to red light.  Our chemical is an air-stable additive, that can be dispersed into paints for spray coating onto existing glass and plastic greenhouses. The additive consists of a downshifting molecule, that absorbs UV light and re-emits red light that boosts crop yields and their sugar content. The surface texturing of our film provides diffused light, which enables more light to impinge on the leaves lower down (angled light), consequently increasing crop yields. The global greenhouse sidings and polytunnel market is expected to grow to circa $12b by 2030. Business model: direct (B2B) sales by 2025. Lambda plans to subcontract the scaleup of the active material to chemical manufacturers and subsequently sell it to greenhouse sidings manufacturers (who will coat their sidings with the active chemical), who will in turn sell their products to our end-users, the growers. Alternatively, we can sell directly to growers. Considering the submarkets we will likely capture and the economic value we can offer to growers (annual £25,000/acre of extra revenue), we expect to generate a revenue of £326m at a penetration rate of 2% in 2030. We expect to make £4.20 of gross profit per square metre of material, which will be sold to the grower at £14 per square metre. The payback is 2.3 years. Lambda will break even in 2026.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":2.7,"shareusd":0.57,"country":"United Kingdom","region":"Cambridgeshire","city":"Cambridge"},{"id":"GMC Instruments","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Automotive, Chemical, Energy, Medical, Telecommunications","HeadquartersLocation":"Nürnberg, Bayern, Germany","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":2.7,"shareusd":0.57,"country":"Germany","region":"Bayern","city":"Nürnberg"}]
