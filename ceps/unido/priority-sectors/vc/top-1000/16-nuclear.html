In partnership with leading international corporations, CORE POWER aims to deliver durable zero-emission energy for floating industrial production and deep-sea shipping. Advanced atomic technologies are set to create the first sustainable zero-emission energy system for ocean transportation and represents an economic opportunity worth $27 billion by 2040. It can form the start of a ‘second atomic era’, where climate change is the main driver of powerful, inexpensive, and safe new energy solutions.  Over the next few decades as many as 60,000 ships must transition from combustion of fossil fuels to zero-emission propulsion. The UN’s maritime agency IMO has mandated with unanimous approval from 174 countries that shipping must reduce emissions by 50% of the 2008 total, before 2050. This means an actual emission reduction of almost 90%, by 2050. The m-MSR can achieve that goal alone, by producing green sustainable fuels for the smaller ships and powering the largest ships. Zero emissions come as standard. Advanced atomic technologies are like atomic battery packs. Small, with few moving parts, it can be a third cheaper to run than a large fossil fuelled engine. It massively reduces waste, and is fuelled-for-life, avoiding proliferation of spent fuel. Advanced atomic technologies can be inherently walk-away safe. Atomic reactors produce heat. Therefore, the coolant is the key to safety. This is the very definition of passive walk-away safety which will create a positive public opinion. Advanced atomic technologies have an economic potential which is greater than that of oil and gas.

The ARC reactor (known as the ARC-100) can be used for distributed power, incremental capacity additions, load following, and base load applications. Additionally, because of its size, dispatch flexibility and robust safety features, the ARC reactor will be an attractive option for non-traditional uses, such as water desalination, shale oil extraction and hydrogen production. The non-proliferation features of the ARC-100 make it suitable for deployment anywhere in the world. The reactor's design creates a \"walk away\" passive safety system that insures the reactor will never melt down even in a disaster that causes a complete loss of power to the plant site.  Moreover, the 20-year fueling cycle gives the customer a high level of energy security, while outsourcing the complexity of fueling operation.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1.66,"shareusd":0.87,"country":"Canada","region":"New Brunswick","city":"Saint John"},{"id":"Advanced Measurement Messtechnischer Service","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Industrial, Nuclear, Test and Measurement","HeadquartersLocation":"Lauffen Am Neckar, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1.66,"shareusd":0.87,"country":"Germany","region":"Baden-Wurttemberg","city":"Lauffen Am Neckar"},{"id":"Stuart Hunt & Associates","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Health Care, Nuclear, Public Safety","HeadquartersLocation":"Edmonton, Alberta, Canada","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1.66,"shareusd":0.87,"country":"Canada","region":"Alberta","city":"Edmonton"},{"id":"Iljin Power","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Energy, Manufacturing, Nuclear, Renewable Energy","HeadquartersLocation":"Ulsan, Kyongsang-bukto, South Korea","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1.66,"shareusd":0.87,"country":"South Korea","region":"Kyongsang-bukto","city":"Ulsan"},{"id":"Nuclear Safety & Technology Services","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Fuel Cell, Nuclear, Product Design","HeadquartersLocation":"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States","FullDescription":"Nuclear Safety & Technology Services offers nuclear criticality safety, nuclear safety engineering, nuclear reactor core design, packaging and transportation analysis, and particle transport analysis services.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1.66,"shareusd":0.87,"country":"United States","region":"Nevada","city":"Las Vegas"},{"id":"Stadtwerke Schkeuditz","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Commercial, Customer Service, Nuclear, Power Grid, Renewable Energy","HeadquartersLocation":"Schkeuditz, Sachsen, Germany","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1.66,"shareusd":0.87,"country":"Germany","region":"Sachsen","city":"Schkeuditz"},{"id":"JINA-CEE","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Association, Education, Non Profit, Nuclear","HeadquartersLocation":"East Lansing, Michigan, United States","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1.66,"shareusd":0.87,"country":"United States","region":"Michigan","city":"East Lansing"},{"id":"ENWESA","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Industrial, Manufacturing, Nuclear","HeadquartersLocation":"Heras, Cantabria, Spain","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1.66,"shareusd":0.87,"country":"Spain","region":"Cantabria","city":"Heras"},{"id":"Senigallia","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Nuclear, Security, Training","HeadquartersLocation":"Thurso, Highland, United Kingdom","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1.66,"shareusd":0.87,"country":"United Kingdom","region":"Highland","city":"Thurso"},{"id":"A analys","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Energy, Nuclear, Power Grid, Risk Management","HeadquartersLocation":"Stockholm, Stockholms Lan, Sweden","FullDescription":"The analysis group was formed in 1987 after the Chernobyl accident, when there was an urgent need for partially difficult to access knowledge.
