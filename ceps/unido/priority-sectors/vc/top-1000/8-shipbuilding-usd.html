Irving, Limited (JDI) has operations in Canada and the United States. JDI is a team of 15,000 dedicated employees, with business units in: Agriculture, Construction & Equipment, Consumer Products, Energy, Food, Forestry & Forestry Products, Retail & Distribution, Shipbuilding & Industrial Fabrication, Transportation & Logistics.  Since JDI's inception over 130 years ago, their employees continue to build JDI into a diverse group of performance-driven enterprises. It is through their dedicated team using the best practices to make the best products that enable them to better serve their customers - at home and around the globe.  The seeds of our entrepreneurial diversity were first sown by company founder James Dergavel Irving (J.D. Irving) - the son of enterprising immigrants from Dumphries, Scotland.  The original company holdings included: a sawmill, gristmill, carding mill, a general store, lumber business and three farms. J.D. was an innovator and a dedicated investor in new methods, equipment to improve productivity and service - a tradition that we carry on today.  Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving, born in 1899, inherited his father's entrepreneurial spirit and keen interest in business. K.C. was a driven and dynamic builder of enterprises who \"liked to see the wheels turn\". Under his leadership, the business realized significant growth and diversification in the transportation, shipbuilding, construction and retail sectors.  In 1957, James K. (J.K.) Irving (K.C.'s eldest son) pioneered the company's reforestation and tree improvement programs and expanded our forest products' business. Over the past 55 years the company planted over 925 million trees - a national record in Canada. Trees, being nature's air filters, absorb carbon dioxide to combat global warming. Today, continual reforestation is sustaining jobs and value-added operations that J.K. and his sons have grown over the years.  Like the generations before them, J.K. and his sons, Robert and Jim, are builders. They believe that good products, superior service, continuous improvement and the front-line efforts of skilled employees are the most important ingredients to success.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Agriculture; Forestry; Animal Husbandry; Hunting; Trapping; Fishing","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Advertising; business","sharen":0.41,"shareusd":2.54,"country":"Canada","region":"New Brunswick","city":"Saint John"},{"id":"Hypertherm","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Consumer Electronics, Manufacturing","HeadquartersLocation":"Hanover, New Hampshire, United States","FullDescription":"Hypertherm designs and manufactures the world's most advanced plasma cutting systems for use in a variety of industries such as shipbuilding, manufacturing, and automotive repair.

D’Isernia. As the owner of a fleet of commercial fishing vessels, Mr. D’Isernia ventured into the world of shipbuilding after learning first hand that the only way to get the type of vessels he wanted was to design the vessels, write the specifications, and build them himself. As he built and developed his own personal fleet of vessels, other professionals in the industry took notice and also began desiring their own custom built vessels. Soon customers in areas including New England, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska were contacting Eastern with requests for customized fishing vessels. By 1980, 26 commercial fishing vessels had been constructed and delivered. Building on his passion for boats and the sea, Mr. D’Isernia decided to diversify Eastern’s reputation from a ‘Fishing Vessel’ shipyard into a shipyard that could fulfill any type of custom vessel request, large or small. In 1981, Eastern’s diversification began with the delivery of their first Offshore Supply Vessels. Today, Eastern’s history includes a portfolio of over 350 vessels and Eastern is one of the most diverse vessel construction companies as a result of its state of the art production line and fabrication process.

And if you care about Bainbridge, you count on the Review for local news, opinion, sports and coverage of the arts. Tucked into the central Puget Sound, a half-hour by ferry from downtown Seattle, Bainbridge Island has made its share of history, from 19th century shipbuilding at Port Madison, to 20th century lumber milling at Port Blakely, to the crucial role the island's military installations served in winning the war in the Pacific during World War II. The Review has been there to cover it all, even making a little history of its own along the way as the only West Coast newspaper to defend the rights of Japanese-American citizens during the war. Today, with weekly publication as part of Kitsap Newspaper Group/Sound Publishing Inc., the Review is committed to keeping 20,000 islanders -- and, via the Internet, Their many friends and family members abroad -- up to date on this amazing little community around them. Annual special sections highlight local leaders and volunteers, women in business, scholars and athletes, and tourism destinations. If it happens on Bainbridge Island, we've got it covered. In fact, the Review earned first place for General Excellence in the 2001 and 2004 Washington Newspaper Publishers Association contest, and third place in 2002, 2003 and 2009 among newspapers with circulations of 5,001-9,000, besting 22 peer publications around the state.
