Tusaar was established in 2009 to commercialize a metal sequestering technology developed at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The development and research have been funded by the US National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy. Most industrial and environmental waste streams contain more than a limited number of polluting metals that need to be effectively removed before the water can be safely discharged. The vast majority of current media-based technologies target a limited number of metals and operate under strict conditions. Other separation technologies need complex systems to operate and are sensitive to various contaminants regularly found in these waters. The Tusaar technology involves the surface treatment and impregnation of granulated activated carbon with environmentally friendly organic compounds. It works in an acidic environment, targets over 40 different metals, requires minimal pre-treatment, and is simple to use. In most applications, the metals sequestered can be recovered if necessary although preliminary testing shows that metal saturated media also passes EPA mandated TCLP tests. The technology has one issued patent and two pending. It will find application in treating industrial waste and process streams, recovering/recycling rare earth & precious metals and the sequestering of actinides. The technology offers significant advantages in its ease of application, cost, and wide applicability.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":3.6,"shareusd":1.5,"country":"United States","region":"Colorado","city":"Lafayette"},{"id":"Star Minerals","value":3614022,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Mineral, Mining","HeadquartersLocation":"Perth, Western Australia, Australia","FullDescription":"Star Minerals is a gold explorer, with an advanced development-ready project and extensive land holdings.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":3.6,"shareusd":1.5,"country":"Australia","region":"Western Australia","city":"Perth"},{"id":"Idaho Strategic Resources","value":3579500,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Mining, Natural Resources, Oil and Gas","HeadquartersLocation":"Kellogg, Idaho, United States","FullDescription":"Idaho Strategic Resources is a junior mining company that maintains a strategic and domestic presence in the Critical Minerals sector and is focused on advancing its officially recognized Diamond Creek and Roberts Rare Earth Element projects in central Idaho.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":3.6,"shareusd":1.5,"country":"United States","region":"Idaho","city":"Kellogg"},{"id":"Adamence","value":3558539,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Jewelry, Online Portals, Precious Metals","HeadquartersLocation":"Palaiseau, Ile-de-France, France","FullDescription":"Established in 2005, Adamence is a pioneer in online jewellery sales.

We have a mission to help to accelerate the decarbonisation transition in the Maritime transportation sector with objectives to reach the International Maritime Organisation’s targets and reduce a minimum of 50% of GHG emissions by 2050.  To comply with decarbonisation regulations, ship owners must measure emissions, and track and report them to the authorities after every voyage. To achieve these objectives shipping companies have to gather as much data from their ships as possible and measure the current performance of their fleet against recognised benchmarks such as EEXI and CII. Ideally, these measurements should be automated to ensure that data is consistent, comprehensive and comparable.   Unfortunately, on 85% of the world’s fleet, this data is collected and reported manually, and in most cases, it is impossible to work with and analyse it.  The question is: Why it’s still collected manually? Because available solutions to digitalize those processes onboard the ship in many cases are very complex and require significant budget expenditure.  That’s why Shipping is running behind decarbonisation targets and under pressure to step up its efforts to invest in digital decarbonisation technologies.  That’s why at eyeGauge we have created an innovative solution that automatically and cost-efficiently collects the data from all systems onboard the ship in a contactless and non-invasive way.  Our solution delivers consistent, comprehensive and comparable data, creating a Digital model of the vessel’s equipment and machinery that help to analyse operations and identify potential areas for optimisation to reduce GHG emissions.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Testing","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":3.6,"shareusd":1.5,"country":"France","region":"Ile-de-France","city":"Paris"},{"id":"Vista Clara","value":575000,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Environmental Engineering, Manufacturing, Mining, Rental, Sales","HeadquartersLocation":"Mukilteo, Washington, United States","FullDescription":"Vista Clara is a manufacturer of advanced nuclear resonance (NMR) technologies for groundwater, mining, and environmental investigations around the globe.

Some 15 wells were drilled in the 1940’s and ‘50’s and were produced for a time. However, when oil prices plunged in the mid to late 1990’s, the operation became uneconomic and the operator of that time simply abandoned the field. The California Department of Oil and Gas assumed operations and performed abandonment procedures on the existing wells in 2002, which left most of the downhole piping in place.

Johari Shop wants to provide customers with the largest selection of precious jewellery at a marketplace of numerous manufacturers in India with in store previews and 'touch n feel' experience before purchase at our strategically chosen partner stores. Gap: 1. In India with such high regional preferences in designs, selection is the biggest problem in offline jewellery buying. Offline channel can't solve it due to physical and monetary limitations, current online players solve it to a level but it is woefully inadequate as vertical destinations (BlueStone, CaratLane) have their own designs and manufacturing so selection is curtailed there. Horizontal players ( Flipkart, Snapdeal) can't provide a good jewellery buying experience which is very much evident by the fact that the vertical players sell 12 times more than the horizontal players.  2. Even though the pricing and selection in onine jewellery is relatively better but still the online shoppers  tend to have a cold feet when making the actual purchase. How can people spend thousands of dollars on such an intimate shopping experience without even handling the merchandise. 'Touch n feel' is one of the most important parameter after selection.

The history of Stalsmidjan ehf. extends back to the year 1933. Ship repairs and conversions have always been the mainstream of the company's operations. The first steel boat to be built in Iceland was built by Stalsmidjan in 1955, a tugboat with 1000 hp main engine, for the Reykjavík Harbour Authorities. In 1962 Stalsmidjan also built the first Icelandic steel fishing boat. There is a long ship building tradition in the company, which has constructed and modified a total of 36 steel vessels, up to 68 meters in length. Stalsmidjan operates its own slipway in Reykjavík Harbour and a carpenter’s workshop, specialized in ship works and renovations of older woodwork. Stalsmidjan has wide experience in new buildings, improvements and maintenance work both for hydro electric power stations and steam turbine stations as well as in energy distribution systems. Framtak ehf. was founded in the year 1988. In the year 2000 Framtak bought the company Blossi hf, and established the daughter company Framtak-Blossi ehf. This company covers specialized diesel-tuning and automotive workshops, and is authorized as \"Bosch Diesel Centre\" in Iceland. It also operates a retail shop and services for the metal industry. Earlier, the main focus was on the marine sector and Framtak has covered some of the largest and most complicated machinery repair and installation projects, both for Icelandic and foreign owners, but later the land-based industry and the Icelandic power industry became more important factor in the company’s activities. This change in policy lead to contracts with prime companies in the power supply sector, like Orkuveita Reykjavikur, HS Orka, and Landsvirkjun, among others, and Framtak has undertaken and overseen some of the largest and most complicated geothermal power plant projects in Iceland in the recent years. In December 2006 Stalsmidjan bought all shares in Framtak and Framtak-Blossi ehf. and henceforth they worked closely together, with mutual office and workshop facilities in new housing in Gardabaer and a big workshop at Grundartangi. In 2013, Stalsmidjan and Framtak merged as Stalsmidjan – Framtak ehf. and is now one of the biggest company of its type in Iceland, offering a wide range of services and solutions in the machine, shipping and metal industry.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":3.6,"shareusd":1.5,"country":"Iceland","region":"Gullbringusysla","city":"Garðabær"},{"id":"A&M EDM","value":55926,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Industrial, Industrial Engineering, Mining, Precious Metals","HeadquartersLocation":"Smethwick, Staffordshire, United Kingdom","FullDescription":"A&M EDM provides precision engineering services.

This is it. In an industry whose stock valuations are exploding as you read this.     We are developing a process called Ionic Migration Leaching to recover metals from subterranean deposits using in-situ electrodes to collect, precipitate, and remove metal ions. This revolutionary process can be powered by solar, wind or natural gas fuel cell produced electricity. Our technology is benign to the environment causing minimal disturbance as only the desired metals are extracted and removed leaving original rock strata in place and untouched. In essence this technique reverses the natural processes that formed the deposits in the first place.    A deposit containing in excess of $500 million value of uranium has been identified and is being acquired. This deposit is within an area identified by a US government agency as containing an estimated 200 million pounds of uranium resources. These resources were thought to be too low grade to produce in the past. Ionic Migration Leaching would make them profitable to extract at current prices.     This investment should be viewed as high risk - high reward. If we are successful, early investors could receive a return of ten to one or more.

By harnessing recycled aluminum as fuel, we are able to produce hydrogen and electricity at a cost that is competitive with not only other renewables (solar, wind, etc), but also with fossil fuels. Who are we? Our team includes bright, dedicated individuals from Google, NASA, Harvard, Stanford, MIT and even a Forbes 30 Under 30. We are a small, but very strong and tight-knit team and beyond just being a team, we are all good friends. How do we do it?  By orchestrating a series of chemical reactions, we are able to strip aluminum of a thin, naturally-occurring barrier. Once this barrier is stripped, the aluminum will freely react with water to liberate hydrogen from the water molecules. Why is nobody else doing this? Simple - until Trolysis came along, it has been a \"net-negative\" process. The sheer fact that it took electricity to split water (electrolysis) or remove the barrier from aluminum (pulverization) meant that the output of the system (hydrogen) would be less energy than what was put in.  What we do differently is eliminate the need for electricity input by utilizing chemical reactions. this means you're converting chemical energy (which is abundant) to hydrogen and electricity (which are valuable and scarce).

High energy costs have been a major global problem for more than forty years. Although these costs have been subject to volatility, the fundamental issue has not gone away and the impact of energy costs will continue to be extremely significant in the foreseeable future. Particularly hard hit as the crisis has continued are industrial, residential, and institutional sectors of the economy. Many such high energy users depend on fuel-oil fired boilers, furnaces, and engines for their heating and processing needs. While much attention, funding and development work has been focused on expanded solar, wind and nuclear power possibilities, few practical alternatives are available in the foreseeable future for the reduction of fuel oil based energy costs. At the same time as the pressing need to reduce the cost of fuel-oil requirements, another critical challenge is both the regulatory and voluntary demands to improve the environmental impact of existing and new fuel-oil heating and processing equipment. Beginning 2010, CavitroniX™ expects to commercialize its proprietary E2C® fuel emulsion technology to a large oil-consuming market in both the United States and in foreign markets. This technology has proven its value in the lab and field applications.

The company’s main products are primary aluminium, aluminium alloys, foil and alumina. RUSAL is a completely vertically integrated aluminium company with assets right through the production process – from bauxite and nepheline ore mines to aluminium smelters and foil mills. This provides RUSAL with exceptional operational flexibility and enables it to control every stage of the manufacturing process and ensure the highest quality of products. RUSAL operates in 19 countries on 5 continents. The company’s core smelting capacities are located in Siberia, thus benefiting from the access to the renewable and environmentally clean hydropower and the proximity to the thriving market of China. With aluminium industry facing oversupply challenges, RUSAL optimizes its capacities through suspending the least efficient smelters and converting them into producers of value added products. At the same time RUSAL builds new highly effective smelters in Eastern Siberia in order to get ready to the demands of the balanced market when aluminium consumption creates enough room for existing capacities.
