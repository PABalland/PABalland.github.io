ExtractoDAO is developing the world's first decentralized exchange (DEX) to trade various smart contracts. Soon, any startup or company will be able to list their contracts on the platform, fractionate their products into several parts, and sell them independently in the market. Users can trade smart contracts with the simple execution of their individual contracts, and buyers receive their legal rights. Our DEX exists to revolutionize the trading market of real physical economy products on the blockchain. It will be possible to issue futures contracts for various commodities such as energy, oil, gas, coal, metals, and even agricultural commodities that have not received attention from the exchanges. Each issuer of the contract must follow the laws of the capital market in their country and register their contracts with the relevant regulatory bodies. ExtractoDAO will always work alongside regulators to ensure the existence of a democratic financial market. ExtractoDAO is a platform like Ethereum where anyone can generate tokens, but ExtractoDAO does the opposite of Ethereum's idea by allowing the issuer to create only smart contracts for their goods, thus bringing the true futures market of the real economy to the blockchain. However, Ethereum is not legally responsible for any errors committed by third parties issuing tokens on its platform as it only provides technology, just like ExtractoDAO does. Any country in the world, including those with poor economies in remote regions, can now list their companies and products for trading and global visibility for traders worldwide. ExtractoDAO is bringing trillion-dollar volume markets to product trading using blockchain technology, thereby adding value to society and attracting investors who previously did not believe in cryptocurrency technologies. ExtractoDAO is a platform focused on establishing a fair and transparent marketplace that benefits all participants. Our primary objective is to support small-scale producers who often face challenges in accessing capital for their production endeavors. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, we strive to cultivate an ecosystem that fosters trust, efficiency, and accessibility, empowering these producers to secure the necessary resources for sustainable production. One of the distinguishing features of ExtractoDAO is our intention to list a wide variety of assets that are not traditional commodities or securities. Our platform is designed to support the trading of innovative and unique products that fall outside these conventional categories. Looking ahead, once our platform is fully operational and compliant with regulatory requirements, we aspire to expand our offerings to include both commodity futures and a broader range of non-commodity assets. We aim to become a pioneer in the industry by providing a comprehensive suite of futures products that cover not only traditional commodities but also non-commodity assets, thereby driving innovation and transforming the market. At ExtractoDAO, we believe in the importance of providing a decentralized trading environment (DEX) for assets that are not commodities or securities. We recognize that many of these assets may not have access to regulated exchanges, despite playing a significant role in the economy by generating jobs and contributing to society in various ways. Our DEX is designed to deliver a fair and transparent market where these unique assets can be traded securely and efficiently. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure the privacy of individuals involved in transactions, enabling holders of these assets to trade with confidence and protection. Furthermore, ExtractoDAO offers a smart contract repository that guarantees the correct and immutable execution of agreements between involved parties. This functionality creates a reliable environment where all transactions are recorded and can be transparently verified, providing security and trust to market participants. Regarding the issuance of smarts contracts on our platform, we aim to promote inclusion and accessibility for assets that would typically not have access to a regulated exchange. Through appropriate evaluation and compliance processes, We understand that many of these assets have a significant impact, employ people, and contribute to the sustainable development of various sectors of the economy. In doing so, we seek to level the playing field and offer opportunities for companies and projects that do not fit into the traditional categories of commodities or securities to obtain funding, grow, and continue contributing to the well-being of society.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":0.5,"shareusd":0.17,"country":"Brazil","region":"Parana","city":"Curitiba"},{"id":"Accordant Energy","value":333333,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Renewable Energy","HeadquartersLocation":"Rutland, Vermont, United States","FullDescription":"Developer of a multi-pollutant emission control technology designed for environmental pollutant reduction.

BHE seeks investment from individuals ($10,000 - $25,000 range each) and groups.     Timing for the project is excellent. US gas producers are highly motivated to find new markets. Low cost US natural gas enables BHE's project to be economically attractive.     The project uses US natural gas as feedstock to produce methanol. Methanol is used in China to produce olefins which are then used to produce plastics. HIgh volume plastics manufacturing is China's strategic plan. Massive construction is now underway in China to expand olefin production capacity.     In China, methanol is produced from coal. Over use of coal is causing severe air and water pollution. Since the Chinese Government’s “war on pollution” declaration in March, 2014, coal use in China is increasingly restricted. Today Chinese groups seek alternative sources of methanol from overseas. Several groups plan to make large investments outside of China in methanol plants to control supply costs rather than buy \"\"retail\"\" priced methanol from large, foreign owned companies. Also, Chinese groups seek local country partners for such endeavors. They seek well developed projects that are major investment ready.     BHE's USA based project is a very good fit for major Chinese investment. BHE's site is already EPA permitted and ready for methanol plant investment and construction.

Waste heat has long been recognized as a vast energy resource. Waste heat power generation equipment is already a fast-growing industry with players like GE and United Technologies. However, all current technologies require waste heat of 200-500 degrees F or more and most require as found in industrial sites. Most if not all require large amounts of cooling water. Untapped until now is over 1 trillion kWh per year of low-grade waste heat from commercial air conditioning and refrigeration, equal to the heat from over 170,000,000 tons of coal.  Every watt of electricity used for AC/R results in about four watts of this easily captured heat, with a typical temperature of 120 degrees F, varying by time of day and season. This new patented technology uses the intermittent and variable temperature low grade heat. The system uses a new patented mode of heat transfer and recycles its own waste heat.  It does not require cooling water.

By making it easy to go green, Mpower helps people do their part to fight climate change and help the environment. Once you switch to Mpower, the company tells your local utility, and you’ll be informed of the date when your home will start receiving clean energy. You’ll continue to receive one bill from your utility, and your utility will continue to read your meter and handle service issues. That’s it—no extra bills, no equipment installation, no ongoing maintenance. With Mpower, the transition to clean energy is seamless.     Today, utility bills fluctuate a great deal because of changing oil and gas markets around the world, but the clean energy sector is much more stable. This allows Mpower to deliver a product with a consistent and predictable cost. Furthermore, Mpower charges no fees for signing up or terminating a contract, and the decision to change back can be made at any time.     The simple change of switching to Mpower can have a resounding impact on your community. Mpower actively gives back to the communities it operates in and hires directly from the areas it serves. Furthermore, switching to Mpower can help reduce and reverse the harmful effects of burning fossil fuels. Mpower uses wind and solar power—two renewable energy sources that do not produce harmful pollution or greenhouse gas emissions. By choosing clean energy through Mpower, every year, you’ll save around 7,000 tons of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas causing climate change. This impact is similar to planting 165 trees.     Switching to clean energy through Mpower also benefits people as well as our environment. Besides causing climate change, the pollution from fossil fuels can cause serious health problems like heart disease, asthma, cancer, and premature death. It’s estimated that in 2010, the fine particulates (soot and similar pollution) from U.S. coal power plants caused 13,200 deaths, 9,700 hospitalizations, and 20,000 heart attacks. In contrast, solar and wind power plants produce no emissions when they’re operating. The benefits of switching to Mpower are clear—for people, communities, and the environment.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":0.5,"shareusd":0.17,"country":"United States","region":"New York","city":"Brooklyn"},{"id":"Stella Jones","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Infrastructure, Manufacturing","HeadquartersLocation":"Saint-laurent, Quebec, Canada","FullDescription":"Stella-Jones Inc. is a producer and marketer of pressure treated wood products.

That movement is rising from the bottom up all over the world, and is uniting to create the solutions that will ensure a better future for all. 350.org was founded by a group of university friends in the U.S. along with author Bill McKibben, who wrote one of the first books on global warming for the general public. When they started organizing in 2008, they saw climate change as the most important issue facing humanity — but climate action was mired in politics and all but stalled. They didn’t know how to fix things, but they knew that one missing ingredient was a climate movement that reflected the scale of the crisis. So they started organizing coordinated days of action that linked activists and organizations around the world, including the International Day of Climate Action in 2009, the Global Work Party in 2010, Moving Planet in 2011, and Climate Impacts Day in 2012. They held the “world’s biggest art installation” and “the most widespread day of political action in the planet’s history.” They figured that if they were going to be a movement, then they had to start acting like one. Click here to watch videos of these global mobilisations.  Today, 350.org works in almost every country in the world on campaigns like fighting coal power plants in India, stopping the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S, and divesting public institutions everywhere from fossil fuels.

Crude oil, natural gas, and coal cover today the majority of our global energy needs. But the related emissions of greenhouse gases have caused the planet’s climate to change in an unnatural manner. The world is ready for change, and the political will to act on environmental issues is here. Unfortunately, renewables are not as reliable as conventional power plants, and electricity cannot be stored in the power grid. To ensure that the transition away from fossil fuels is a practical and achievable goal, we need efficient facilities to store renewable energy. Therefore, Green Energy Wallet (GEW) connects batteries of many electric vehicles to use this capacity as a large buffer store for renewable energy. Solar power systems and home batteries can also be integrated. We connect charging stations with the power grid to manage the electricity with flow either way between the power grid and the battery. Bidirectional charging stations of several manufacturers can be connected to GEW. In addition, we will develop together with a partner a bi-directional charging station tailored for GEW. GEW works together with the energy provider to buy electricity when the price is low because of overproduction and sell it high when the power grid system needs it. In addition, GEW can ensure the power supply of your home when the power network fails. Our GEW app can communicate between the electric vehicle, home system, charging station, and power grid. Additionally, the GEW app will contain many more useful functions, such as providing easy access to the vehicle’s and home’s system settings and diagnostics. GEW rewards clients through a GEW token reward system for providing buffer storage and data and for using our GEW network.

When an Insurance building company contacts us for a trade company they search that trade in that area via their database of AIBN accredited trades, once they find a AIBN accredited trade they call them and discuss the opportunity and who its with, payment terms etc. Once they have an AIBN accredited trade that is interested and suitable they send there details to the person from the insurance building company to take it further.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":0.5,"shareusd":0.17,"country":"Australia","region":"New South Wales","city":"Kingscliff"},{"id":"Clintwood JOD","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Industrial, Mining, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"Belcher, Kentucky, United States","FullDescription":"Clintwood JOD provides production plants, ample ground storage, multiple convenient rails, truck, and barge transportation, coal mining and production, capital equipment, safety, and compliance services.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":0.5,"shareusd":0.17,"country":"United States","region":"Kentucky","city":"Belcher"},{"id":"Mining Association of British Columbia","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Manufacturing, Mining","HeadquartersLocation":"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":0.5,"shareusd":0.17,"country":"Canada","region":"British Columbia","city":"Vancouver"},{"id":"SAM Private Equity","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"","HeadquartersLocation":"Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland","FullDescription":"SAM Private Equity is an investment firm specialized in direct and fund of funds investments.

The Company operates distributed flexible 'gas to power'​ generation plants providing both predictable and fast response capacity to the grid. Alkane now has a total of 160 MW of installed generating capacity and an electrical grid capacity of 175 MW. Alkane’s portfolio of generating plants includes sites utilizing abandoned coal mine methane (‘CMM’). Alkane has the UK’s leading portfolio of onshore petroleum exploration and development licenses ('PEDLs'​) specifically awarded to enable the Company to extract gas from abandoned coal mines and is the largest operator of Coal Mine Methane in the UK. As CMM declines at any one site Alkane retains valuable generating capacity and a grid connection that it can use to provide flexible generation in to the power response market. Flexible generation sites are connected to mains gas and produce electricity at times of high electrical demand or in order to balance the electricity grid particularly during periods when intermittent renewable energy is not available. It has a clear strategy in place to retain its market leadership in abandoned coal mine methane generation and to increase its capacity of reliable distributed flexible generation. The demand for flexible technologies is increasingly driven by the power system requirement to balance the intermittency of weather dependent renewable generation. Its proven capability in developing and operating flexible technologies will enable the company to build on its successes.

What better credentials would a manufacturer of mining equipment need? In other words, they have \"been there and done that.\" They understand the inner workings of mining equipment first hand because they have \"hands on\" experience that some manufacturers may lack. That speaks well for  the quality of equipment Johnson Industries manufactures and explains the unsullied reputation they have earned over the years. Johnson Brothers Coal Company was established in 1974 by five Johnson brothers - Greg, Garla, Gwendel, Garnie, and George, all coming from different walks of life, but all with an innate ability to think and create. Their ability to design innovative solutions to the challenges they faced on the job paid off. The Kinney Branch Company that Garnie supervised became the highest ton per man hour coal producer in the United States. A  back injury shortened George's coal mining life, but maybe it was a \"blessing in disguise,\" because after that he devoted his time to design and production. In 1981, they established Johnson Industries and immediately started manufacturing the industrial duty car, followed by the Super Low Tail Piece. A patented laser alignment tool for the underground mining industry (Slimm-Jim Laser) was developed next and it quickly gained industry acceptance. Johnson Industries' next proud accomplishment was the Stinger - an MSHA permissible and explosion proof personnel carrier that became a top seller in the industry. One rugged product after another has emerged from Johnson Industries, with each piece proving increased efficiency and improved safety.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Generation; Conversion Or Distribution Of Electric Power","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":0.5,"shareusd":0.17,"country":"United States","region":"Kentucky","city":"Pikeville"},{"id":"Wave Construction Group","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Energy Efficiency, Mechanical Engineering, Oil and Gas","HeadquartersLocation":"Mystic, Connecticut, United States","FullDescription":"Wave Construction Group is a mechanical service company that focuses on exhaust path installation, maintenance, and repair as well as pipe systems within a wide range of industries, including utility and power generation facilities.

This company named BIOeCON was founded in 2006 and in 2007 it started a Joint Venture named KiOR. This Joint Venture went public in an IPO and is now traded on NASDAQ. At this moment KiOR has started its first commercial plant in Columbus, Mississippi, and is producing cellulosic gasoline and diesel from forestry wastes. In 2010 BIOeCON entered into a Joint Development Agreement, this time with a state owned oil giant from Brazil called Petrobras. The project named BiCHEM is focused on developing an technology for the production of high value chemicals and fuel additives from agricultural wastes. This technology is now being scaled-up by an international R & D team at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. After the establishment of KiOR, BIOeCON founder Paul O’Connor decided that the next logical step from bio-based fuels would be solar fuels and so he founded in 2010, together with his companion Sasa Marinic, the company Antecy with the goal of developing technologies for renewable and sustainable energy production. After all, biomass is nothing more than million years of solar radiation stored via biomass like plants and trees into fossil fuels like natural gas, coal and oil. So actually, Antecy does the same as what nature does, namely producing a fuel with help of the energy of the sun, only more efficient. While biomass is able to absorb approximately 1–2 % of the sun’s radiation and after converting it to a fuel, there is only 0.6 – 1.2 % of the solar energy left. PV on the other hand can absorb approximately 23 % and after converting it using the Antecy technology there is still more than 10 % of the solar energy left and we must keep in mind that the efficiency of PV still shall improve the coming years.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Physical Or Chemical Processes Or Apparatus In General","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":0.5,"shareusd":0.17,"country":"The Netherlands","region":"Gelderland","city":"Hoevelaken"},{"id":"Silver Bay Prosperity Trading","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Procurement, Property Development, Retail, Wholesale","HeadquartersLocation":"Hong Kong, Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":0.5,"shareusd":0.17,"country":"Hong Kong","region":"Hong Kong Island","city":"Hong Kong"},{"id":"Progressive Industries","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Industrial, Manufacturing, Product Design","HeadquartersLocation":"Sylacauga, Alabama, United States","FullDescription":"Progressive Industries provides air classifying and grinding systems.

Capturing the methane improves mine/facility operations by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and volatile organic compounds associated with the methane. VCS develops markets for methane reduction by lobbying, directly engaging regulatory agencies, joining strategic trade associations, and developing and operating economic pilot projects.  VCS leverages these markets to turn a waste and pollutant into a resource. VCS wrote the first Abandoned Mine Methane Protocol in the USA which was approved by the Verified Carbon Registry2.  VCS successfully lobbied in the state of Colorado to accept Methane emissions from coal mines as renewable3.  And they participated in the working group which advised the California Air Resources Board in drafting the Mine Methane Capture Protocol4.

The method, known as Oxidative Hydrothermal Dissolution (OHD) is simple, using only hot (subcritical) liquid water and oxygen to break down these macromolecular organic materials into their constituent aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The OHD process can also be used for environmental remediation of organic-containing sites, such as oil sands tailings and coal waste ponds. This modular, environmentally–friendly process produces very little CO2, giving the technology a low carbon footprint. OHD requires no pre-treatment of the feed, or additional catalysts, enzymes or solvents (other than water). The OHD bioliquor can be used as a fulvate-type biostimulant and soil enhancer, and high-value, platform biochemicals can also be recovered as saleable products through an add-on option to the main conversion process. The product suite depends on the choice of feedstock and the process conditions. Thermaquatica’s goal is to use OHD technology to produce chemicals similar or identical to petroleum-derived products, using low-cost alternative raw materials such as waste biomass or coal. The resulting products can be sold as fine chemicals, used in manufacturing of biodegradable plastics and polymers, and/or converted to liquid fuels.

However, the privately owned Denver Energy Exploration LLC is adding a new type of business to this market. This independent oil and gas operator, with a license from the Railroad Commission of Texas, is founded on the principles of working together with the community and owners of small businesses, with particular focus on reaping profit from the Brookshire Salt Dome oil field. A brief look at the oil and gas industry in general will help provide some background to the activities and goals of Denver Energy Exploration. Oil and gas are responsible for providing 60% of the daily energy needs of the world population of almost 7 billion people. The remaining 40% is provided by coal, hydroelectric and nuclear power, renewable energy and biomass products, e.g. firewood. This is a rough indication of the significance of this market. The world demand for crude oil increased by an average 1.76% per annum between the years 1994 to 2006, and is expected to increase a further 37% by 2030, according to the US Energy Information Administration, to reach a peak of 118 million barrels of oil per day. On the other hand, recent years have seen a slowdown in oil supply growth, creating a situation of record high prices today, with earnings in the industry reaching new heights, more parties becoming involved in the marketplace and activity increasing exponentially. Denver Energy Exploration was founded in 2001 by Michael Christopher, who continues to manage the company today. He is ably assisted by a carefully selected team of professionals and experts in their fields, who complement his own acquired experience and knowledge in the field of oil and gas. The management team includes geologists, engineers and finance professionals. These key people ensure the sustainability and growth of the company in this fiercely competitive market. The company was established with the aim of sharing in the profits and opportunities of the Brookshire Salt Dome project, and this remains its main project. This oil field, covering some 8000 acres, has supplied approximately 10 million barrels of oil to date. Based on production of other salt domes in the area, it is estimated that the potential of the Brookshire Salt Dome is in excess of 100 million barrels, indicating that there is still a lot of oil out there. Denver Energy Exploration LLC deploys the latest and best technologies to develop its leases including Neozoic geophysical and 3D seismic surveys and additional geological data. The company has a number of leases in the Brookshire project in various areas of the site, including the apex area and the north-eastern, southern and eastern flanks. To its credit, Denver Energy Exploration has the highest rating from the Better Business Bureau (BBB) – an A+. Factors contributing to this excellent rating include the company’s length of time of operation, its sterling customer service and solid business ethics. Much of this success can be accredited to manager, Michael Christopher, and under his continuing leadership, the future seems promising for the company.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":0.5,"shareusd":0.17,"country":"United States","region":"Texas","city":"New Braunfels"},{"id":"Kumarasamy Industries","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Industrial, Industrial Manufacturing, Manufacturing","HeadquartersLocation":"Panruti, Tamil Nadu, India","FullDescription":"Kumarasamy Industries is a manufacturer of CNSL (Cashew Nutshell Liquid) and mineral-based products.
