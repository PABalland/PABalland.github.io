In 1988 Ferroli joined forces with Brassware Sales, a company based in Minworth, West Midlands, which was importing heating products from Italian manufacturers, and they took on the name Brassware Ferroli. The success of this joint venture proved the UK market to be a viable one and in 1997, after nine years of continued growth, the two companies went their separate ways and Ferroli UK Ltd was established. By keeping a very keen eye on what the market demanded and ensuring that it kept pace with its competitors, Ferroli UK swiftly expanded until it outgrew the Minworth premises and relocated to the current site in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire in January 2001. By this stage, Ferroli had identified its key aim as being to supply the UK independents market and this remains a major focus of the company’s operations today. Driving the development of Ferroli’s range of domestic and commercial boilers and renewable energy products is the two-pronged catalyst of relentless consumer demand for better products and the need to address climate change. It’s these factors, which are at the same time both complementary and conflicting, that keep Ferroli at the leading edge of appliance design. One of Ferroli’s biggest strengths is self-sufficiency: from the initial concept through to design, manufacturing and marketing, Ferroli’s products are produced entirely in-house, with only a very small percentage of components being sourced from elsewhere. This allows for complete control over the quality, delivery and all-important aftersales aspects of all Ferroli’s products. Ferroli has brought many innovative heating appliances into the marketplace, from high efficiency domestic combi, system and open vent boilers to a wide range of renewable products, including complete solar systems, plus an extensive range of commercial boilers. In 2015 the majority share of the company was transferred to Oxy Capital Italia, based in Milan, and UK-based Attestor Capital, with the Ferroli family retaining an interest in the company.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":4.1,"shareusd":2,"country":"United Kingdom","region":"St. Helens","city":"Burton-on-trent"},{"id":"Aim Processing","value":18000000,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Industrial, Manufacturing, Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing, Professional Services","HeadquartersLocation":"Longmont, Colorado, United States","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":4.1,"shareusd":2,"country":"United States","region":"Colorado","city":"Longmont"},{"id":"PolyCharge America","value":17901529,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Electronics, Industrial, Manufacturing","HeadquartersLocation":"Tucson, Arizona, United States","FullDescription":"PolyCharge is a company of Sigma Technologies founded in September 2017 that develops and commercializes NanoLam™ technology for electric drive vehicles, renewable energy inverters, medical, aerospace, and industrial mobility applications.

Through its patented Balanced Charge Agglomeration™ (BCA) technology, ISOPur is able to achieve a level of fluid purity unattainable by conventional filtration or centrifugal systems. ISOPur not only continuously purifies oil and fuel to a better than new condition, BCA also removes sludge and varnish from the internals of the machinery. ISOPur can provide a dramatic return on investment by improving plant uptime, reducing maintenance costs, extending the life of expensive capital equipment, and reducing fluid consumption and waste disposal. ISOPur’s patented BCA technology works by passing contaminated fluid over a series of electrodes that carefully charge particles, both positive and negative, until the net charge is balanced. As charged particles mix, they attract and grow in size, making for easy removal with filter cartridges. BCA is a revolutionary technology within the purification industry because of its effectiveness on sub-micron particles that would otherwise pass freely through premium filters. BCA accomplishes this level of ultra-fine purification while maintaining fluid lubricity and water content without affecting additives. BCA also “pulls” sticky sludge and varnish off the internals of machine valves, bearings, shafts, and other critical parts, enabling equipment to operate more efficiently and reliably. Conventional filters impart a net static charge on particles, causing them to attract to internal surfaces and initiating the process of varnish formation. BCA restores a balanced charge in the fluid, blocking particle attraction and eliminating the fundamental cause of sludge and varnish formation. BCA removes contamination from any non-conducting fluids. In addition to hydraulic oil and lubricating oil, BCA has also been proven effective on cutting/machining oils, phosphate esters, and vegetable oil. BCA removes contaminants of many varieties, including sub-micron particles, products of oxidation, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and bacteria. ISOPur has referenceable case studies from major Global 2000 corporations in a multitude of industrial applications including power generation, pulp and paper, plastic extrusion, marine, petrochemicals, food processing, transformers/tap changers, machine tools, and general manufacturing.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Physical Or Chemical Processes Or Apparatus In General","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments","sharen":4.1,"shareusd":2,"country":"United States","region":"Connecticut","city":"North Stonington"},{"id":"AIMACH Automation","value":7905676,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Industrial, Industrial Manufacturing, Manufacturing","HeadquartersLocation":"Changzhou, Zhejiang, China","FullDescription":"AIMACH Automation specializes in the design and production of CNC tool cribs.

By developing solid-state production methods to improve electrodes, the company produces batteries using less energy, materials, and equipment. Intecells is breaking manufacturing out of its decades-long stasis toward a future full of new products and capabilities. Founded in 2018, Intecells invented solid-state printing techniques leveraging cold plasma to fundamentally change the way electrodes are shaped and built into flexible cell formats. The company is revolutionizing what is possible not only for manufacturing and environmental impact but also for consumer product creation for years to come. Partnering with leading battery makers, OEMs, and academic institutions, Intecells plans to bring its innovations from lab to production in 2022. The startup is the brainchild of Dr. Shawn Gayden, a Chinese American inventor, and business executive, who led battery manufacturing research for more than a decade, and Christian Buske, a German entrepreneur whose company first commercialized cold plasma technology decades ago. Intecells’ technologies eliminate binders and solvents for a cleaner electrode-making process, thereby opening new paths for a wide range of cell chemistries and applications across sectors at low production costs.     This game-changing endeavor is a rising tide that lifts everyone in the value chain. For materials and equipment suppliers, collaborating with Intecells adds value to products; for cell manufacturers, applying Intecells’ technology means they can write the rules for future battery production; and for OEMs, Intecells innovations eliminate many traditional and costly design constraints.  By adapting proven cold plasma technology to solve new problems, Intecells’ technology allows the battery to follow product form, not the other way around. The company’s new technology shrinks battery size, with limitless possibilities for shape, while retaining the same power output for less money. In the short term, Intecells is working to demonstrate its flexible batteries that offer personalization for a new wave of consumer products.  The company’s long-term goal is to revolutionize the electric vehicle battery industry and accelerate renewable energy storage.

With Zunum Aero, simply drive to a nearby airfield and walk to your aircraft with bags in tow, for a trip that will take half the time and at a much lower fare. Or skip the meeting altogether, and be on the slopes in Tahoe by 8:40 AM for $100 round-trip, and back home the same evening. We are a land of towns and communities, many with airports, but few with regular air service. Our stock of 13,500 airports is the largest in the world, yet just 140 of the largest hubs carry over 97% of air traffic. This has left many of us with long drives to catch a flight, while on shorter trips we skip air travel altogether. Communities without good air service also struggle to attract investment and create jobs. Electric aircraft of varying sizes are ideally suited to this critical need, requiring little support other than a GPS flight path and a quick recharge or swap facility on the tarmac. Be it Moses Lake, Beaumont, Santa Fe or Butte: prepare for the convenience of frequent electric air service. Did you know that short-haul flights produce over 40% of aviation emissions? With our aircraft, we believe these will be largely eliminated within twenty years. Our aircraft are “hybrids to electrics” that sip fuel only when they have to, will use even less over time as batteries upgrade, and will one day go completely without — so that flying will be kind to the Earth.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Aircraft; Aviation; Cosmonautics","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":4.1,"shareusd":2,"country":"United States","region":"Washington","city":"Bothell"},{"id":"DaStrong","value":800000,"value2":1,"parent":"No Artificial Intelligence Industry Tag","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Commercial, Electronics, Industrial, Manufacturing","HeadquartersLocation":"Buffalo, New York, United States","FullDescription":"We provide an electromagnetic force driven,bearing-free, and oscillating blade-cooling module.
