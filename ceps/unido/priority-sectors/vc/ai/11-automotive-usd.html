A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system across its lifecycle, using real-time data to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning. In terms of automated production and level of digitalization, the construction industry is still significantly behind other industries. Nevertheless, the megatrends like Big Data or the Internet of Things offer great opportunities for the future development of the construction sector. Prerequisite for the successful Construction 4.0 is the creation of a digital twin of a construction site. CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling) enables architects and planners to come together and work on a set of 3D models. This in return, creates an interactive project which promotes real-time collaboration. When the architects and engineers are collaborating, planning and sharing the information of the project, they are effectively employing CIM. Through the use of CIM, projects of any scale are able to be constructed, this could be something as small as an individual building to a full-fledged town. CIM’s ability to offer improved results at a lower cost is what drives the change from traditional methods in the industry. Along the total life cycle from design to construction, operation and maintenance towards remodeling or demolition, the digital twin follows all modifications of the real construction site and dynamically readjusts itself in case of recorded performance differences. Thus, for the whole lifespan of the real construction site, performance predictions generated with the virtual twin represent an accurate basis for well-informed decisions. DigitalTwin Technology is a construction technology company operating out of Cologne Germany. DigitalTwin Technology is the first company in the world to make use of VR and AR for digital twin in the tunneling segment of the construction industry for CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling). Tunnelware is a VaaS (Virtuality as a Service) for tunnel construction industry to manage the construction process while managing the data generated by various sensors and human interaction.

The software automatically retrieves, uploads, organizes and saves entire search sessions on the cloud. Users can then access these search sessions on any device.  With a mixture of intrigue, frustration, and awe for the power of information in our day and age, the founders of Onedepth, Alex Park and Thomas Arthur, sought out ways in which they could help make search, the gateway for online information, more of an experience than a task.  Realizing that search was outdated in many ways, having had no major innovations within the past decade, the founders of Onedepth decided to place emphasis on post-query navigation, or the phase in which people are actually spending the majority of their time, sifting through content to ultimately make decisions, discover, or create something of value.  Feeling that search data was just as important as individual files, the founders of Onedepth aimed to create a service that helped users store their search data and truly navigate through it while not having to manually clip, copy, save or print individual web content.  Onedepth is currently in Beta.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1,"shareusd":1,"country":"United States","region":"California","city":"San Francisco"},{"id":"Elisium","value2":1,"parent":"Italy","Industries":"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Automotive, Information and Communications Technology (ICT)","HeadquartersLocation":"Spilamberto, Emilia-Romagna, Italy","FullDescription":"Elisium is an information and communication technology company that operates in the fields of artificial intelligence, telematics, and data processing.
