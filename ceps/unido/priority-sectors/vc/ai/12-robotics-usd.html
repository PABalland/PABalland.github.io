An AI Based Diagnosis Solution makes it possible for doctors to spot lesions while performing a coronary angiography, perform segmentation of the vessel in question within just one second and analyze the lesion’s status. 2. A Guide & Planning Solution clearly visualizes the hidden part of the coronary artery to make doctors perform guidewire manipulation with more ease and confidence, which is quite useful especially in case of CTO. Furthermore, the solution frees doctors from the need to use contrast -- this is important because contrast can cause potentially fatal reactions in 5 to 10% of patients. 3.

We believe that by training end to end controls in simulation with reinforcement learning and above that iterating hardware designs, we can automate the whole development process. At the current stage, the most important resource is a large fleet of robots to validate our approaches for our AI system and to collect data. This would help keep us grounded in reality.  To start building up the fleet, we invented an automatic tile grouting robot that boosts productivity by 5x and are piloting it on construction sites in Singapore managed by Woh Hup, BHCC, Gin Chia, Soilbuild, and Dragages. We have early leads in the US and Europe as well. Tile grouting is the process of filling up the gaps between tiles after the tiles have been laid. Grouting is part of virtually every construction project and a highly laborious process, is considered one of the most physically damaging tasks resulting in tilers’ knees and back issues, and thus quality issues would also arise.  We invented a patent pending robot that is able to automatically grout and clean tile gaps with only a press of a button. The operators would only need to reload grout and water. We are headquartered in Delaware, and have offices in Singapore and Brno, Czech Republic. Demo locations include Zurich, Miami, London/Cambridge, and Vienna.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1,"shareusd":1,"country":"Singapore","region":"Central Region","city":"Singapore"},{"id":"DeepMotion","value":2200000,"value2":1,"parent":"United States","color":"#365a94","Industries":"Animation, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality, Cloud Computing, Digital Entertainment, Machine Learning, Robotics, SaaS, Simulation, Video Games, Virtual Reality","HeadquartersLocation":"Redwood City, California, United States","FullDescription":"DeepMotion is building a motion intelligence platform for digital humans and virtual creatures powered by deep learning in the cloud.

We believe in owning the full stack from the lowest levels of software to the actual hardware. We design and produce robots under one roof to accelerate our iteration cycle. Our integration starts all the way from the firmware to the electricial engineering to the actual assembly of the robot. Foundational to our mission is the ability for the robot to see the world in 3D using just regular cameras. We developed a neural network to see the world in depth using stereo cameras and a SLAM system to locate our robot in 3D space. We believe that the fastest and the most robust way to learn about the world is through interaction. When our robot encounters a novel object, it can move around to observe the object from different angles and viewpoints to acquire more data. Matician is led by repeat founders Navneet Dalal and Mehul Nariyawala. Navneet has a PhD in Computer Vision and is perhaps best known for his thesis, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), a landmark in computer vision research, which remained the state-of-the-art for 10 years with over 35,000 citations. Navneet and Mehul were early employees at a startup called Like.com, which pioneered facial recognition in images in 2005 and was acquired by Google in 2010. Next, they started Flutter (Y Combinator W12), a startup that built on-device hand-gesture recognition. The algorithms worked locally on the device using the webcam with just an 800kB footprint. And yet, Flutter beat the state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and recall, leading to its acquisition by Google in 2013. At the time of acquisition, Flutter was the #1 Mac Store app in 73 countries and its users had performed over 77 million gestures. At Google, they helped launch Google Cardboard at Google Research. Later, the team moved over to Nest where Mehul was the Lead PM for Nest Cam and Navneet led the algorithms team. The team conceptualized and launched Nest Cam Outdoor, Nest Cam IQ, and Nest Hello Doorbell along with other computer vision features such as person and stranger detection. In 2017, Mehul and Navneet returned to the startup world, co-founding Matician. They have since grown the team to over 25, including Google, Tesla, and Cisco alumni, all working together to bring the vision of home autonomy into the hands of our customers.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Controlling","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Machines and machine tools","sharen":1,"shareusd":1,"country":"United States","region":"California","city":"Palo Alto"},{"id":"Type One Ventures","value2":1,"parent":"United States","color":"#365a94","Industries":"Aerospace, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Financial Services, FinTech, Robotics, Software, Space Travel","HeadquartersLocation":"Malibu, California, United States","FullDescription":"Inspired by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev’s method for measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement - the Kardashev scale.

Based on Mckinsey Report that the last mile delivery makes up to 53% of total logistics costs on any shipment. Its like you buy a $5 breakfast but you have to pay another $5 for delivery and this is NOT ok!  If you've ever been waiting for a parcel eagerly when you are home or not home but you find out the delivery person has been gone and he didn't even call you or ring the bell and your parcel is just left outside of our house to weather being damaged or stolen. If any of this has ever happened to you, congratulations! You're most certainly NOT alone! So we are using autonomous robot to solve last mile delivery problems. The robot will delivery your packages or food by travelling on the sidewalk and pedestrian areas autonomously. It will be able to navigate itself to your doorstep and once the robot arrives, you can unlock the robot to pick up your package by using your phone otherwise the robot will unload the package into the Pre-installed secured safe drop automatically in front of the houses just in case failed deliveries.  The robots will assist and help repetitive deliveries in the next following years. They are replacing humans and vehicles that may be doing those last one or two miles with autonomous robots. Our final goal is to reduce the delivery fee to $1. No matter how late you go home you can still get the parcel inside the secured safe box instead of driving all the way to the parcel locker just to pick up your item. You can also return your items easily at low cost, you can simply just put them back into the box and the robot will come and pick them up.
