AEInnova redefines the iIoT creating the most advanced device for predictive maintenance. It is fully battery-less, free of maintenance and completely autonomous and self-powered. The solution called InduEye allows vibration monitoring, steam trap monitoring, thermal monitoring being all of them powered by Waste Heat (and new versions with solar PV and Wind). Its main innovation comes from his patent (accepted in the US, Canada, and EU) that allows multiplying the performance of the device compared to any other competitor. that is summarized allowing full edge computing (FFT in real-time, Velocity in RSM in real-time, etc), using the most advanced wireless standards such us LoRaWAN or NB-IoT  / LTE-CAT M, allowing communications every few seconds of latency. The solution has the CE MARK and the ATEX / IECEX certification. FCC ongoing. The technology is working in real industrial facilities in the following customers: + Oil&Gas (Repsol SA, Cepsa SA, ILBOC oil refineries). + aluminium (Derichebourg). + IRON & Steel (Arcelor Mittal, Celsa SA). + Paper (Gomà Camps SA). + Rubber & tyres (Sacyr Valoriza, Cirtec). + Leachate plants (Ferrovial Servicios). + Water Treatment plants (Aigues de Mataró). + Coal Power plants (ENEL). + Chemical plant (ERCROS). + Soybean plant (BUNGE). + Subway (Metro Barcelona). + Cement and concrete (Ciments Molins, Promsa). Data of AEinnova's IoT devices are represented in one of the most advanced IoT cloud-based dashboards in the market, with full data analytics, alarms, alerts, environmental impact analysis (LCA), and predictive maintenance tools. AEInnova is a TOP EU leading scale-up awarded by 27 international prizes due to its innovative technology (IoT World Cup, Santander X, United Nations Global Compact, Industrial Internet Consortium, United Nations Ideas 4 Change, Green Building Council, Repsol Foundation, EBAN, 6 seals of excellence from the European Comissions, etc). In 2022 it is ranked in the Top 30 EU Scale-ups and in the Top 10 in sustainability, being the TOP EU Innovator in Autonomous Sensor.
