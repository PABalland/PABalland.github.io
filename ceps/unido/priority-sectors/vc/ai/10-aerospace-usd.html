SynapseMX solves these problems with a mobile-first platform that allows teams to plan, track, and accomplish their maintenance from anywhere, while seamlessly keeping them in sync with what’s going on around them. To get them out of ‘firefighting’ mode, we help them anticipate and plan for upcoming maintenance events so that they can stop surprising their customers with delays. All of that leads to our true value – the operational insights that we enable for our customers. We help identify deviations that impact their ability to have ‘dispatch–ready’ aircraft. For example, identifying a maintenance technician that’s 18% faster than peers for a given task. Why? Did they find a better way to get the job done (good!), or are they cutting corners (bad!). Both answers will have a powerful impact, and SynapseMX helps them realize that those questions exist.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","sharen":1,"shareusd":1,"country":"United States","region":"Georgia","city":"Atlanta"},{"id":"UBIQ Aerospace","value2":1,"parent":"Norway","Industries":"Aerospace, Intelligent Systems","HeadquartersLocation":"Trondheim, Sor-Trondelag, Norway","FullDescription":"UBIQ Aerospace is an autonomy enabler devoted to building solutions that expand aircraft capabilities.
