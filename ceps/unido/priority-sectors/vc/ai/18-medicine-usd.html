In November 2018, MediPixel won the championship in the QuickFire Challenge hosted by Johnson & Johnson.  MediPixel currently offers three solutions for intervention surgeons: 1. An AI Based Diagnosis Solution makes it possible for doctors to spot lesions while performing a coronary angiography, perform segmentation of the vessel in question within just one second and analyze the lesion’s status. 2. A Guide & Planning Solution clearly visualizes the hidden part of the coronary artery to make doctors perform guidewire manipulation with more ease and confidence, which is quite useful especially in case of CTO. Furthermore, the solution frees doctors from the need to use contrast -- this is important because contrast can cause potentially fatal reactions in 5 to 10% of patients. 3. An Automated Navigation Engine automates navigation through coronary arteries. Once the destination is reached, it controls a robotic unit by giving the most appropriate real-time commands in its existing situation, thus delivering devices such as guidewire to the destination in the most efficient way.

Their AI platform has enabled them to develop a purpose-built therapy for ARDS to reduce its $20 billion cost on society (just in the USA).    GEn1E has built a rich pipeline of 21+ novel and selective immunomodulators and has plans to accelerate 2 additional devastating diseases (beyond their lead indication) to IND in the next 12 months. Their AI platform enables tremendous pace and capital efficiency as demonstrated by their progress in ~2 years with seed capital—a stark contrast to the typical spend of $100M+ and 7+ years exhibited in the pharmaceuticals / biotech industry.   With ~90% of rare diseases having no therapeutic treatment at all, GEn1E is taking a giant swing that will hopefully bring life-saving therapies to the lives of patients in need.   GEn1E’s team has decades of experience in drug development and machine learning, and they graduated from YCombinator and Stanford-StartX in late 2019.

At the core of every electronic product is the electronics (hardware) and firmware (software) needed to run it. Mircod experience and multi-disciplines enable the company to provide turnkey development of: • Circuit Schematics: Analog & Digital, Gerber Artwork, and Layout Design. • Embedded Systems. • Firmware & Micro Controller Programming Software Design. • User-Interface Development. • Hardware Design for CE, FCE, UL, ROHS, WEEE, and FDA. The ability to provide the right, properly “up and running” comprehensive prototype for the desired idea, while selecting the precise components, defines all aspects of a product's performance, realistic proof of concept, durability, cost, and successful market penetration. MIRCOD brings together personnel with substantive expertise in all primary disciplines required to deliver the most complicated hardware and software solutions. This flexible and multi-skilled team brings an inherent understanding of the R&D in hardware and software related activities and the interfaces with other system delivery disciplines (mathematical algorithms, system engineering, sourcing, advanced materials, and manufacturing) required for success. MIRCOD also has the advantage of having worked on a diverse range of activities across a varied customer base in both production and prototyping capacities. BIOTECHNOLOGY Industry - MIRCOD actively participates in R&D projects initiated by international consortiums. Gene therapy technology developed in consideration with international top cell and gene biotech companies and universities, guarantees to transform tomorrow's medicine by treating the causes of disease rather than the manifestations. IoT Industry - We make the Internet of Things easy from Sketch to Scale. MIRCOD white-labeled rapid IoT web-based platform for rapid design, prototyping, design, and manufacturing is a hardware and software-agnostic system with white-label mobile apps, private BA and BI, complete device management, custom-defined analytics, and advanced AI. ROBOTICS Industry - MIRCOD AI-enabled robots are designed to work with scientists on a daily basis in a high demanding space at biotech laboratories. The MIRCOD autonomous robotic arms can be left alone to perform time-consuming biotechnological tasks in R&D biotech labs like setting up comprehensive predefined experiments in POC stations. HEALTHCARE Industry - MIRCOD team believes that today's remote monitoring technology isn't sufficiently advanced to predict a potential adverse event and alert a monitoring provider before disaster strikes. Our mission is to enhance these technologies and bring to the market an “ease of use” remote monitoring technology platform that enables continuous, configurable, wireless acquiring of biometric parameters from the human body.
