For buyers and sellers of perishable goods, Transparent Path creates real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility technologies that reduce waste, cost, and risk.  WHO WE ARE: Former senior executives from the food, tech, and social impact sectors, from companies like Amazon, IBM, Xerox, Microsoft, Target, and General Mills. We came together in 2020 to use the skills we honed over long careers to create meaningful positive impacts. Our social mission: to keep food, medicines and other critical perishables out of landfills.  Founded as an LLC in 2018. Restructured and launched as a social purpose corp (C-corp) in 2020.  PROBLEM Supply chain data technologies have been underfunded for generations — still largely powered by paper, faxes and disconnected systems. These antiquated approaches were incapable of handling the enormous systemic strains caused by pandemic-related labor and equipment shortages, disruptions, and growing, complex regulation. Paper systems mean shippers and receivers can't manage what they can't see. So we decided to combine a number of advanced technologies and new approaches for today's challenges, including AI, IoT, 5G, printed electronics, and machine vision. SOLUTIONS We bring both software and hardware solutions to the market to reduce cost, waste, and risk in perishable supply chains.  -- PRODUCT 1: The Transparent Path Visibility Platform (PaaS). Customers affix our continuously-connected cellular sensors to pallets entering the supply chain. These sensors constantly capture and report the location, temperature, humidity, and other factors for these shipments into our visibility cloud. This platform was built with collaboration in mind. Supply chain partners are grouped in Consortiums — dynamic partnerships based around common trade relationships. Product customers are tracked, easing data sharing and showing who's \"got the ball.\"  When location or conditions jeopardize our customers' products, we send out real-time alerts to the appropriate parties who can intervene and save the shipment, along with its freshness, safety, and financial value.  -- PRODUCT 2: FreshScore™ - our patented predictive freshness algorithm targeted at buyers. FreshScore uses both production data and supply chain environmental data to predict the freshness of perishables before they arrive at retail. This unique algorithm arms food producers with quality control data, allowing for the routing of the best product to the best customers, minimizing surprises and rejections. It also helps reduce waste by anticipating freshness and viability issues before they occur. We are partnering with ReFED, the top food waste non-profit, to bring this technology to market. -- PRODUCT 3: ProofScore™ - our \"credit score for transparency.\" ProofScore is a patented algorithm that scores perishable producers and products based on data transparency. The more data shared with supply chain partners and consumers, the higher the ProofScore.  ProofScore puts information into the hands of consumers, answering the question, where did this product come from? How did it get to me? What happened to it along the way? ProofScore-ranked products can command higher margins and grow stronger customer satisfaction. We are partnering with a large Japanese multinational firm on its development.  -- PRODUCT 4: ProofTracker - our eco-friendly sensor device. This advanced temperature/humidity/shock tracker is a cellular gateway built on biodegradable materials.    BENEFITS Our products reduce customers' supply chain losses, retailer rejections, insurance premiums, wasted time, and labor costs spent on reconciliations. They also reduce negative impacts to natural capital, including keeping food and perishables out of landfills. Using our system, all supply chain partners know exactly what's happening to products in transit — reducing disputes while improving collaboration and trust. And customer relationships are maximized by the delivery of fresh, safe products at full margin.  CUSTOMER PROFILE Transparent Path technologies support food, pharmaceuticals, blood/plasma, transplant organs, and construction chemical shipments. The company also currently provides asset tracking for high-end hard goods.  PARTNERSHIPS Transparent Path has created partnerships with Intel, T-Mobile, Duke University, and ReFED. Intel has donated hardware, software, and ongoing counsel since 2020. We are working with Second Sun Laboratories to develop the most advanced hardware in the market, and with a large multinational Japanese tech manufacturer to develop ProofScore.  ACCELERATORS/INCUBATORS Over its short tenure, Transparent Path has been accepted into numerous accelerators, including 5G Open Innovation Lab, Microsoft for Startups, NewChip, and most recently, Plug and Play IoT.  FUNDRAISING To date, Transparent Path has been funded via bootstrapping, two RegCF raises, three grants, and four angel investors. In April 2023, the company was awarded grants totaling $440,000 from the National Science Foundation, ReFED, and the State of Washington. The company is building traction toward a Series A that will fund sales scaling and feature expansion.   FOR MORE INFORMATION Headquartered in the US, Transparent Path was founded by Eric Weaver, a 30-year enterprise transformation specialist. Prior to founding the company, Weaver launched the Xerox Customer Experience Practice, where he managed a $550M services book of business. His executive team includes senior leaders from Amazon, General Mills, Microsoft, Target, KraftHeinz, Xerox PARC, and the University of California at Berkeley.

Genome analyses are the basis for most research and development projects in the life sciences. Genome data is used, for example, to study the effects of drug candidates in animal experiments in the pharmaceutical industry. Genome mapping is crucial for breeding new varieties in the seed industry, and in biotechnology for developing yeasts with new properties. Every day, thousands of genomes are sequenced worldwide. However, most of this data is difficult to find and usually only one aspect of the data is analysed.  Analysing genome data means assigning a function to each individual letter in the genome. The difficulty is that genomes are up to 30 billion letters long but consist of only 4 different letters. And only about 1% of the letters in the genome contain important information like genes. Based on 20 years of genome research, we have developed a new, proprietary software, which we use in combination with a database of all the world's sequenced creatures to perform genome analyses with unprecedented quality and speed.
