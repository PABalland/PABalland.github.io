Electrochemistry has many operational, cost, and sustainable benefits such as using 40% less energy, avoiding toxic chemicals and waste, and enabling new types of molecules. Despite interest in pharmaceuticals to develop electrochemical molecules, many molecules don't make it past process development. For most applications, the many years of optimization and additional training required don't justify the energy and cost savings. Sunthetics develops smart electrochemical reactors that enable process chemists to develop at-scale processes in 1/10th of the time. Our effective hardware is scalable and effective, and enables fast results through a machine-learning platform that is automatic and predictive, reducing the experiments needed for development by 10x. Though the beachhead market is pharmaceuticals, Sunthetics has a platform technology that can be scaled and applied to follow-on markets such as agrochemicals and specialty chemicals, spearheading the electrification of the chemical industry.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Texas","city":"San Marcos"},{"id":"Quantum Boost","value":700000,"value2":1,"parent":"Europe and Central Asia","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Chemical Engineering, Information Technology, Machine Learning, Software","HeadquartersLocation":"London, England, United Kingdom","FullDescription":"Quantum Boost develops artificial intelligence that delivers new insights into your experimental data, so you can make better decisions about your product development process.
