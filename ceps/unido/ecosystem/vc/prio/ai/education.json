DMAI's vision is to lift humanity by developing cognitive AI assistants and platforms that make personal connections to individuals. We seek to explore the dark matter of intelligence - the 95% “invisible” (i.e., functionality, physics, intent, causality, and human utility, through top-down inference and reasoning) that helps us understand the \"visible\" 5% we see with our sensory inputs. Where others build standardized methods, we seek to create personalized ones. Some stats that motivate us include: - Only 30% of Americans have a college degree. - Only 66% of non-native English speakers graduate high school. - 45% of Americans are living with a chronic health problem. - 68% of Americans don’t feel engaged in their jobs.

Driven by a belief that anyone can learn guitar, but not everyone is taught well, we cut through the noise to give guitarists a comprehensive education that actually sticks.

For us, the goal is mastery but with continual improvement. So, we’ve combined the insights of educational experts and professional musicians with advanced AI technology to create a truly innovative learning tool. That’s why we offer a structured Learn Path alongside tailored practice plans, daily guitar workouts, a large song library, and interactive jam sessions.  We tackle playing guitar from every angle because that’s how confident, versatile guitarists are made.  As passionate musicians, we count being able to express ourselves through music as one of life’s greatest joys.
