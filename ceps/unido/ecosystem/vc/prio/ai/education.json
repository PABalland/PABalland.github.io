The schools of the university include School of Architecture, College of Arts and Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, School of Law, School of Medicine, McIntire School of Commerce, Darden Graduate School of Business Administration, and School of Nursing. The university offers 51 bachelor's degrees in 47 fields, 84 master's degrees in 67 fields, 6 educational specialist degrees, two first-professional degrees (law and medicine), and 57 doctoral degrees in 55 fields. Affiliated with 7 Nobel laureates, it has produced 5 NASA astronauts, 7 Marshall scholars, 4 Churchill scholars, 29 Truman scholars, and 50 Rhodes scholars. Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in 1819. He wished the publicly-supported school to have a national character and stature. It is the first non-sectarian university in the United States and the first to use the elective course system. Jefferson considered the founding of the university to be one of his greatest achievements. Undertaking the project toward the end of his life after a long and illustrious career that included serving as a colonial revolutionary, political leader, writer, architect, inventor, and horticulturalist, he was closely involved in the university's design. He planned the curriculum, recruited the first faculty, and designed the Academical Village, a terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, gardens, and the majestic center-point, the Rotunda. The most recognizable symbol of the university, the Rotunda stands at the north end of the Lawn and is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda have served as models for similar designs of centralized green areas at universities across the United States. The university was opened for classes in 1825 with a faculty of eight and a student body numbering sixty-eight. Jefferson took great pains to recruit the most highly qualified faculty, five of whom were found in England and three in the United States. Instructions were offered in ancient languages, modern languages, mathematics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy, chemistry, law, and medicine. Jefferson opposed the granting of degrees on the grounds that they were ‘artificial embellishments’. In 1824, however, the Board of Visitors authorized granting the Master of Arts degree. The Doctor of Medicine or M.D. was awarded to the first graduates of the School of Medicine in 1828 and the Bachelor of Law degree or LL.B. was first awarded for law school graduates in 1842. The bachelor's degree was awarded beginning in 1849, but became the standard undergraduate degree and a prerequisite for the master's degree in 1899 bringing the university into conformity with other institutions of higher learning. The PhD has been awarded since 1883.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Casting; Powder Metallurgy","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Virginia","city":"Charlottesville"},{"id":"Amplify Education","value":215000000,"value2":1,"parent":"United States","color":"#365a94","Industries":"EdTech, Education, Higher Education","HeadquartersLocation":"Brooklyn, New York, United States","FullDescription":"Amplify Education is leading the way in creating next-generation curriculum and assessment programs.

Founded in 1876, the university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins. His $7 million bequest (approximately $147.5 million in today's dollars)—of which half financed the establishment of Johns Hopkins Hospital—was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States up to that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as the institution's first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. Adopting the concept of a graduate school from Germany's ancient Heidelberg University, Johns Hopkins University is considered the first research university in the United States. Over the course of several decades, the university has led all U.S. universities in annual research and development expenditures. In fiscal year 2016, Johns Hopkins spent nearly $2.5 billion on research.[9] The university has additional graduate campuses in Italy, China, and Washington, D.C., in addition to its main campus in Baltimore, Maryland.

Your first day in college, your best friend, your dorms, hanging in the corridors, your school canteen, all nighters before exams and chilling for weeks after exams - our school lives are filled with so many awesome interactions, experiences and memories. In each of them you’re with a friend, never alone! Humans always have, and will always continue to learn from one another. We are a social learning platform that allows us to learn the way we learn best - socially Founded by Stanford grads, Openhouse is backed by Accel and Matrix Partners. We have started building a stellar team from companies like Microsoft, Uber, etc.,  We are headquartered in Bangalore.  Our Approach Covid-19 has reshaped every aspect of our lives and education is no exception. The world is learning to learn online but the main reason why online education hasn’t skyrocketed is because all platforms are designed to simply deliver content (whether pre-recorded or live). Online learning doesn’t feel natural, warm or relatable. Taking an analogy from the gaming world, edtech so far consists of single player games designed only for access but not engagement and retention. The only actions one can take is content consumption and practice via multiple choice questions. We, on the contrary, think education is an immersive multiplayer experience! If our children are going to learn online we will have to make it social. That’s how learning happens best. We believe we’re amongst the first few companies in the world trying to push the boundaries of edtech to a new era of highly social and community driven learning. PS: We believe that we need to hire people who are toughened by failure, not those coddled by success. Our Culture The best classrooms have an awesome learning culture. We think of our organisation as one large classroom, where each of us is a student trying to learn from and teach one another.  We have all sorts of people here: humanists, tech junkies, educationists, designers and wanna be designers! Since we are a small organisation, we function like a tight-knit family where we care for each other’s work but also for each other’s lives. We’ve often heard that the first 50 team members set the culture and pace of an organisation, which is why we take time and carefully pick our team. If you grab a sneak peek into our tribe, you’d find us to be super real. We are all encouraged to call a spade a spade, even if this means disappointing a peer. Coming up with prospective solutions is good, but we care about how well the experience is crafted - aesthetics do matter. Think of Disneyland, Nike, Airbnb, WeWork, Apple: the best folks know not only how to deliver a product/service, but also make it beautiful. Most importantly, we are all students! Right across the team. from engineering to product, community to classroom, we think of how we’d feel if we were students – and this reminds us to keep learning and growing!","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"India","region":"Karnataka","city":"Bangalore"},{"id":"Integriculture","value":17171162,"value2":1,"parent":"Japan","color":"#365a94","Industries":"Agriculture, Beauty, Education, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Task Management","HeadquartersLocation":"Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","FullDescription":"Integriculture makes cellular agriculture products to improve sustainability, food security, and reduce public health problems.
