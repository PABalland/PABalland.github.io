In commemoration of India's 75th Independence anniversary, TSC is driving the \"75 Students' Satellites: Mission\" initiative, which was praised by the Prime Minister of India at the 76th UN General Assembly. This mission aims to kindle scientific curiosity in students and contribute to global technological progress while addressing the growing demands of the space sector. TSC has also been honoured with the \"IEI CENTENARY INNOVATION AWARD\" for Startup in the Aerospace Industry at IEI, IIT Kanpur, and the \"Best Technology Award\" by Global Triumph Foundation (GTF INDIA).

This unique technology provides heat, power, and instrument air. HydrodineTM eliminates the need for fuel gas as a heat source and as a pneumatic source for pneumatic devices.  HydrodineTM is a platform technology that has a wide range of applications in several industrial verticals including Oil & Gas, wastewater treatment in municipalities and pulp and paper, aquaculture and hydroponics, and Defence. The patent pending system utilizes a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) blend flowing over a proprietary catalyst. An exothermic decomposition occurs enabling the HydrodineTM system to heat the separator shed. This process is controlled to regulate heat and power requirements to save on costs. The by-products of this process are oxygen and water (in the form of steam). A thermoelectric generator on the beta prototype provides power to run electric devices and a compressor that pressurizes ambient air to be used as instrument air for pneumatic devices. An H2O2 fuel cell is currently being developed for the commercial unit and will produce additional quantities of power.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"Canada","region":"Alberta","city":"Nisku"},{"id":"Magna BSP","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"Middle East and North Africa","color":"#8B4513","Industries":"Enterprise, Intrusion Detection, Military, Security, Video","HeadquartersLocation":"Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv, Israel","FullDescription":"Magna developed a unique system based on 3D cameras and sophisticated algorithm promises over 99% detection rate and only 1 to 24 hour false alarm rate, to avoid these common incidents.
