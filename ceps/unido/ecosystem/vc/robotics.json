By eliminating as much complexity as possible while still being able to perform the operations necessary to do neural net inference and putting that processing as close as possible to the memory, we can get close to theoretical minimum power numbers for the given process (initially targeting 28nm). Neural net inference will become increasingly important on all types of devices. These devices operate with strict energy budgets which in some cases are too restrictive for any current inference technology and in other cases limit overall intelligence due to the maximum inference throughput.

CAST AI's intelligent optimization engine delivers a cost-efficient, high-performing, and resilient infrastructure for every Kubernetes workload.  CAST AI brings resource and cost optimization to Kubernetes using an AI-driven optimization engine that applies cluster changes based on real-time workload conditions. It selects the most cost-effective instance types and bin-packs pods for maximum utilization. The platform uses spot instances that offer 70 to 90% discounts and are automatically selected for any stateless workloads. CAST AI also sets pod scaling parameters to achieve optimal application performance while maximizing cost savings. Moreover, users get detailed cost reports to enable forecasting expenses at the level of the project, cluster, namespace, and deployment, down to individual microservices. CAST AI provides an opinionated Kubernetes implementation that hides the infrastructure complexities with automation. So DevOps engineers no longer have to deal with IaaS complexity and can finally focus on higher-order cloud-native abstractions and concepts. They can create and manage CAST AI components through API, CLI, and Terraform to automate their infrastructure lifecycle management. CAST AI also provides services for in-cluster observability (logging, tracing, and metrics) and built-in security (encryption at rest and in transit). CAST AI protects workloads against downtime with a Disaster Avoidance strategy based on cloud neutrality and multi-cloud capabilities. To achieve 100% uptime, CAST AI adopts the active approach to Disaster Recovery by stretching applications and data across multiple clouds so that a cloud failure never becomes a disaster.
