As early as 2008, the UK was considering a ban on patio heaters, with an estimated economic impact in the UK alone of up to 250M euros in lost revenue per year to the pubs, restaurants, and caterers that depend on them. Armita-X is disrupting the entire outdoor space heating industry by making use of our most current understanding of thermodynamics and modern computing to more efficiently generate heat- saving gas, money, and the environment. Our patented technology will be the first to bridge the gap between outdated mechanical devices and modern, intelligent, energy-conscience devices. Armita-X is a marvel in thermodynamic efficiency: Capturing waste in the form excess heat, the unit is able to generate its own electricity. Equipped with wireless networking, even multiple units are easy to control from the palm of your hand. Both the smartphone application and the touchscreen panel on the device provide information regarding the level of propane gas remaining, the duration until the propane gas cylinders need to be exchanged, battery levels, and temperature control options. In addition, the unit is smart enough to automatically power down when a leakage is detected. Ultimately, we envision Armita-X as a modular platform rather than a simple device. Based on needs addressed by customer discovery, we’ve already added the option to add lights, a touchscreen, and speakers, amongst others. Each Armita-X can be customized to match the particular needs of the end-user. A sleek aluminum casing encloses heating elements that better utilize propane gas, generating longer heating periods per unit of gas, and making use of the entire tank. Efficient design incorporates three different heat sources: while the first element helps generate heat quickly, the third element helps retain heat, striking a balance that allows for fast start-up and longer sustained heating periods.  Using proximity sensors, Armita-X knows when to turn on and off, minimizing waste. Pressure sensors remove the guess-work of how much gas is left in the tanks, meaning you’ll no longer effectively throw your money away when disposing of tanks that still have leftover gas. our target market are residential( backyards) and commercial (restaurants,hotels, cafe's, bar's ,outdoor events and parties and etc).","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"California","city":"Canoga Park"},{"id":"DARBCO","value2":1,"parent":"Middle East and North Africa","color":"#8B4513","Industries":"Artificial Intelligence (AI), GreenTech, Internet of Things, Manufacturing, Renewable Energy, Robotics, Software","HeadquartersLocation":"Amman, Amman, Jordan","FullDescription":"DARBCO is the brainchild of robotics in renewable energy.

Currently, we offer a prototype and we are looking for a pilot project where we will prove the value of our software. We are also looking for 200 000 Euro of a seed investment. What problem are we solving? Currently, European Union experiences a continuous growth in wind power share. Together with aging of present installations, there comes an increasing need for optimal operation and maintenance, and a growing interest in asset lifetime extension. According to IRENA’s report on Generation Costs in Renewable Energy, O&M costs can represent even up to 25% of the Levelized Cost of Electricity. Besides, turbine downtime represents a significant portion of costs too. Some components, like turbine gearbox, break down extremely rarely and it is not financially justified to store them on-site. On the other hand, lack of a part for replacement can cause a turbine a pause in operation for many days or even months, generating monetary losses. On top of that, a single wind turbine produces hundreds of data readings every minute, usually used for manual monitoring and stored on the wind farm. What is our product? A thorough consideration leads to the conclusion that a solution bridging the gap between available data and its easy manipulation is greatly needed. Proper data handling may not only enhance the management of the wind farm but also lead to valuable insights, improving its overall performance. The existing advancements in machine learning and big data analytics allow to unlock the potential of renewables, decreasing their overall costs and improving their integration into the power system. WindAlly is a comprehensive software that gathers and analyses data collected from the wind farm, providing valuable functionalities to all stakeholders engaged in the process of wind asset management. The system offers a broad range of capabilities, including wind turbine failure detection, forecasts of wind energy production, facilitated inventory management as well as maintenance work optimization. Resulting predictive maintenance leads to a smaller number of failures in a wind turbine, therefore increasing the odds for asset lifetime extension. All improvements can generate savings up to €20k per megawatt of wind turbine installed for each year over its lifetime. Concluding, WindAlly is aimed at enhancing the work of wind asset managers, wind operation managers and maintenance team, ultimately decreasing the O&M costs of a wind farm and improving its performance. How does WindAlly work? At WindAlly, we are pursuing a holistic approach to wind farm management. The software that we offer is based on four main components: SCADA integration – by integrating data primarily managed by various SCADA systems, the software is aimed to give an access to powerful and concrete insights coming from the data. Failures detection - machine learning-based algorithms are responsible for early failure detection, thus enabling predictive maintenance and consequent cost reductions. Energy production forecasts - advanced models based on artificial intelligence ensure accurate electricity generation forecasts, increasing the ability to avoid costly under- or over-productions. Inventory management - constant insight into spare components in stock along with an updated comparison of available offers enables optimization and automation of upcoming orders. The combination of energy production and maintenance forecasts empowers the wind farm managers to optimize maintenance works by aligning O&M with low energy production, assuring the least costly operation. Further, reduced number of unexpected failures, together with improved inventory management, allow for a decrease in turbine downtime and resulting cut of expenses. The software’s interface is flexible and simple. It is designed to be tailored for each actor engaged in the process of wind farm management and to provide an easy access to the most important information. Additionally, a compatible architecture of our software allows for an integration of any tools that the user currently works with into the platform, eliminating the need for using multiple systems.  Leveraging leading market solutions like Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, gives WindAlly virtually unlimited data processing resources. With the use of products like S3, ingestion of large quantities of data is simple and efficient, allowing developers to focus on developing advanced machine learning solutions to provide industry-leading models.

While predictions are insightful and useful, they often leave it up to humans to make decisions to take advantage of the foresight. Enter Ayata – our software combines Artificial Intelligence (the science of predictions) with Operations Research (the science of decision making). Ayata’s software predicts what’s ahead and prescribes how to take advantage of this predicted future, without disrupting other priorities. For critical processes at large corporations, Ayata's software ingests videos, images, sounds, text, and numbers - together - to continually predict performance metrics and prescribe how to improve this predicted performance.  Since more than 80% of the world's data is unstructured, any technology focused on improving future performance must be capable of taking into account ALL data - not just numbers and/or text - to generate accurate predictions and actionable prescriptions. Ayata’s software can and does.  In Oil & Gas, Ayata's software has modeled more than 14,000 horizontal shale wells from 6 leading operators in 4 major North American shale plays. Results include 9.8% increase in first year production, 100-day decrease in new well breakeven, and 24% increase in per well ROR. In Insurance, Ayata's software is predicting losses for auto and home insurance policies for all US customers of a \"Fortune 50\" Insurance company, and running their claims litigation process end-to-end. In High-Tech, Ayata's software helped Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Dell, and Juniper Networks improve Customer Service, Field Service, Retail Operations, and Parts Logistics.  Ayata already has 35 US Patents – 9 Issued – and 2 US Trademarks. Ayata’s inventions combine disparate scientific disciplines – such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Metaheuristics, and Operations Research – to predict what’s ahead and prescribe how to benefit from this future. Our technology architecture is inspired by the Central Nervous System (“CNS”) in the human body. The CNS orchestrates and controls most of the body’s activities even though such processes are rarely conscious. Ayata’s software does the same for complex, mission critical operations. Ayata’s Board of Advisors include prominent senior executives from Google, Chevron, BP, Deloitte, McKinsey, Barclays, and BHP Billiton. Ayata has been featured on Bloomberg TV (twice), HART Energy Conferences (four times), Deloitte Oil & Gas Conference, Deloitte PPMD Conference, Energy Makers Show, Oil & Gas Investor, E&P Magazine, WIRED, GigaOm, InformationWeek, Gizmodo, and other prominent media venues.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Texas","city":"Austin"},{"id":"Light Ray Ventures","value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Clean Energy, CleanTech, Construction, GreenTech, Robotics, Smart Cities, Transportation, Wellness","HeadquartersLocation":"New York, New York, United States","FullDescription":"At Light Ray Ventures, we leverage experience and capital gained from the successful development of innovative businesses to support scaling the growth stage companies that bring fundamental value to the economy and society.
