(EMI) a New England based energy company with 35 years of experience in energy conservation and energy development. ESS Group, Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts, has been the environmental science specialist for the project. Cape Wind is also being assisted by Woods Hole Group, K2 Management, SgurrEnergy, AWS Truepower, and PMSS. Barclays is Cape Wind’s Financial Advisor.  In 1975, Energy Management, Inc. (EMI) began developing energy conservation and pollution control projects for institutional and industrial facilities. In 1985, the company transitioned to developing independent power projects. The company has successfully developed six natural gas fired electric generation projects. Over the past thirty-five years EMI earned a reputation of completing environmentally superior facilities with ultra-high plant availability. Since 2001, EMI has been focused primarily on developing renewable energy projects including offshore wind, biomass, and solar.  Cape Wind will produce 75% of the electricity used on Cape Cod and the Islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket in average conditions, with zero pollutant emissions, zero waste discharge, and zero water consumption.  Cape Wind will help launch the American offshore wind industry and produce significant economic, environmental, and energy benefits for Massachusetts, the region, and the nation.  Cape Wind will consist of 130 Siemens 3.6-megawatt offshore wind turbines with a capacity of 468 megawatts.  The project will be located in Federal waters off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound, the most technically optimal offshore wind power site in the United States.  Cape Wind’s monopile foundations are individually designed and will be driven deep into the seabed to support the wind turbines.  Transition pieces will be fitted onto the monopiles.  The wind turbine towers will be bolted onto the transition pieces.  Intra array submarine cables will be jet plowed six feet into the seabed and will feed into an Electric Service Platform (ESP) near the center of the wind farm array.  From the ESP, export submarine cables will be submerged and make landfall in West Yarmouth, where buried cables will continue to the interconnect point, the Barnstable Substation.  Cape Wind’s Operations Headquarters will be based along Falmouth Harbor on Cape Cod.  Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound has all of the characteristics to be the optimal location for America’s first offshore wind farm.  This location also makes good sense thinking about both the past and the future of the Cape and Islands.  Not only do the Cape and Islands have a rich history of harnessing wind power, but they now stand to benefit by being a leader in clean energy production to mitigate the impacts of climate change, to which the Cape and Islands are particularly vulnerable.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Massachusetts","city":"Boston"},{"id":"TagEnergy","value":1198203399,"value2":1,"parent":"Portugal","Industries":"Clean Energy, CleanTech, Energy, Renewable Energy","HeadquartersLocation":"Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal","FullDescription":"TagEnergy is a clean energy enterprise for a new cycle in the renewable energy industry.

They bring more than 50 years’ experience in growth investment to Trident, having supported over 800 companies with more than $60bn of equity. The team at Trident Energy is one of the industry’s most experienced in the science of operating and redeveloping mid-life oil and gas assets. It considers fields that are no longer central to their owners’ strategic goals but can still deliver growth by applying fresh thinking, specialist mid-life experience and technology. With forensic attention to detail, the teams re-interpret subsurface data and leverage the existing infrastructure to redevelop and re-energise fields. Activities range from well-work and drilling to near-field exploration. Trident Energy’s vision is to build a geographically diversified portfolio of sizable and producing mid-life oil and gas assets located onshore and offshore, redeveloping and operating them to world-class standards. The group is primarily focused on Africa and Latin America but is open to opportunities in Europe and Asia.  The first acquired assets were successfully taken over from Hess Corporation in 2017. The Okume and Ceiba fields are located in both shallow and deep water in the Rio Muni basin of Equatorial Guinea. At the time of the takeover, the asset was producing 42,000 barrels of oil per day. In just a matter of months, Trident Energy had already increased output by 24% and is continuing to enhance production.

Till now, only 5% of this market has been tapped through ESCO mode mainly in the areas of lighting and some industrial applications and the large-scale implementation of energy efficiency is constrained by a number of important regulatory, institutional and financing barriers. The concept of performance contracting implemented by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) is being increasingly considered as a mechanism to overcome some of the barriers hindering and discouraging the large-scale implementation of energy efficiency projects. However, despite the fact that the potential for application of performance contracting in both the public and private sectors in developing nations is enormous, the growth of the ESCO industry has been particularly slow in the country. In order to develop a viable ESCO industry, Ministry of Power has set up Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a Joint Venture of NTPC Limited, PFC, REC and POWERGRID to facilitate implementation of energy efficiency projects. EESL will work as ESCO, as Consultancy Organization for CDM, Energy Efficiency, etc.; as a Resource Centre for capacity building of SDAs, Utilities, financial institutions, etc. EESL will also lead the market-related actions of the NMEEE. It is registered under the companies Act, 1956 on 10th December 2009 and the commencement of business certificate is obtained on 11th February 2010.

The barges are former military or construction ships with a 40 to 50 year extended life that are in robust working condition and meet all Coast Guard certifications. Nautilus’ first barge is currently under construction at California’s Mare Island where Nautilus has successfully validated its first proof of concept prototype data center. The proof of concept went through a certified third party data center pre-commissioning process and was validated by the engineering firms – Jacobs Engineering and Critical Engineering Group.  Since it is five times more efficient to cool using water versus moving air, Nautilus’ patented cooling technology leverages the natural water that the barge safely rests on and allows the company to offer customers a high-density computing data center environment. Specifically, the waterborne data center can be configured and operated with up to 800 server racks deployed in less than six months anywhere around the world. Nautilus’ cloud solution automates the infrastructure in an open source environment agnostic to any data center, cloud or application. Additionally, Nautilus’ DCIM solution is predictive with integrated artificial intelligence that self heals and provides military-grade security. The Nautilus approach competes directly against the traditional or conventional data center approach by reducing the build time from two years to only six months. The green data center build by Nautilus has 19,000 tons of lower emissions (equivalent to approximately 3600 cars) as compared to the conventional data center. With a potential 50% annual energy savings, the Nautilus design could save clients up to $4 million in energy use cost.

It can form the start of a ‘second atomic era’, where climate change is the main driver of powerful, inexpensive, and safe new energy solutions.  Over the next few decades as many as 60,000 ships must transition from combustion of fossil fuels to zero-emission propulsion. The UN’s maritime agency IMO has mandated with unanimous approval from 174 countries that shipping must reduce emissions by 50% of the 2008 total, before 2050. This means an actual emission reduction of almost 90%, by 2050. The m-MSR can achieve that goal alone, by producing green sustainable fuels for the smaller ships and powering the largest ships. Zero emissions come as standard. Advanced atomic technologies are like atomic battery packs. Small, with few moving parts, it can be a third cheaper to run than a large fossil fuelled engine. It massively reduces waste, and is fuelled-for-life, avoiding proliferation of spent fuel. Advanced atomic technologies can be inherently walk-away safe. Atomic reactors produce heat. Therefore, the coolant is the key to safety. This is the very definition of passive walk-away safety which will create a positive public opinion.

Giga scale applications for these technologies are around the corner: the potential exists for billions of wireless sensors to be installed during the coming decade, with nearly half located inside buildings. However, the challenge of reliably and affordably powering these devices has continued to limit IoT viability at scale. Connected electronics require continuous power, which until now has meant batteries that must be periodically replaced or recharged. Legacy photovoltaic technologies like amorphous silicon cells long used on solar calculators and childrens toys don’t yield sufficient power in the real-world, low light operational conditions for most IoT sensors. At the same time, the exorbitant price tag for high performance, low-light PV technologies like gallium arsenide cells has made them suitable only for space satellite and research applications, not mass-market electronics.
