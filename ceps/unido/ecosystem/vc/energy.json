(EMI) a New England based energy company with 35 years of experience in energy conservation and energy development. ESS Group, Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts, has been the environmental science specialist for the project. Cape Wind is also being assisted by Woods Hole Group, K2 Management, SgurrEnergy, AWS Truepower, and PMSS. Barclays is Cape Wind‚Äôs Financial Advisor.  In 1975, Energy Management, Inc. (EMI) began developing energy conservation and pollution control projects for institutional and industrial facilities. In 1985, the company transitioned to developing independent power projects. The company has successfully developed six natural gas fired electric generation projects. Over the past thirty-five years EMI earned a reputation of completing environmentally superior facilities with ultra-high plant availability. Since 2001, EMI has been focused primarily on developing renewable energy projects including offshore wind, biomass, and solar.  Cape Wind will produce 75% of the electricity used on Cape Cod and the Islands of Martha‚Äôs Vineyard and Nantucket in average conditions, with zero pollutant emissions, zero waste discharge, and zero water consumption.  Cape Wind will help launch the American offshore wind industry and produce significant economic, environmental, and energy benefits for Massachusetts, the region, and the nation.  Cape Wind will consist of 130 Siemens 3.6-megawatt offshore wind turbines with a capacity of 468 megawatts.  The project will be located in Federal waters off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound, the most technically optimal offshore wind power site in the United States.  Cape Wind‚Äôs monopile foundations are individually designed and will be driven deep into the seabed to support the wind turbines.  Transition pieces will be fitted onto the monopiles.  The wind turbine towers will be bolted onto the transition pieces.  Intra array submarine cables will be jet plowed six feet into the seabed and will feed into an Electric Service Platform (ESP) near the center of the wind farm array.  From the ESP, export submarine cables will be submerged and make landfall in West Yarmouth, where buried cables will continue to the interconnect point, the Barnstable Substation.  Cape Wind‚Äôs Operations Headquarters will be based along Falmouth Harbor on Cape Cod.  Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound has all of the characteristics to be the optimal location for America‚Äôs first offshore wind farm.  This location also makes good sense thinking about both the past and the future of the Cape and Islands.  Not only do the Cape and Islands have a rich history of harnessing wind power, but they now stand to benefit by being a leader in clean energy production to mitigate the impacts of climate change, to which the Cape and Islands are particularly vulnerable.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Massachusetts","city":"Boston"},{"id":"TagEnergy","value":1198203399,"value2":1,"parent":"Portugal","Industries":"Clean Energy, CleanTech, Energy, Renewable Energy","HeadquartersLocation":"Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal","FullDescription":"TagEnergy is a clean energy enterprise for a new cycle in the renewable energy industry.

Till now, only 5% of this market has been tapped through ESCO mode mainly in the areas of lighting and some industrial applications and the large-scale implementation of energy efficiency is constrained by a number of important regulatory, institutional and financing barriers. The concept of performance contracting implemented by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) is being increasingly considered as a mechanism to overcome some of the barriers hindering and discouraging the large-scale implementation of energy efficiency projects. However, despite the fact that the potential for application of performance contracting in both the public and private sectors in developing nations is enormous, the growth of the ESCO industry has been particularly slow in the country. In order to develop a viable ESCO industry, Ministry of Power has set up Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a Joint Venture of NTPC Limited, PFC, REC and POWERGRID to facilitate implementation of energy efficiency projects. EESL will work as ESCO, as Consultancy Organization for CDM, Energy Efficiency, etc.; as a Resource Centre for capacity building of SDAs, Utilities, financial institutions, etc. EESL will also lead the market-related actions of the NMEEE. It is registered under the companies Act, 1956 on 10th December 2009 and the commencement of business certificate is obtained on 11th February 2010.

It can form the start of a ‚Äòsecond atomic era‚Äô, where climate change is the main driver of powerful, inexpensive, and safe new energy solutions.  Over the next few decades as many as 60,000 ships must transition from combustion of fossil fuels to zero-emission propulsion. The UN‚Äôs maritime agency IMO has mandated with unanimous approval from 174 countries that shipping must reduce emissions by 50% of the 2008 total, before 2050. This means an actual emission reduction of almost 90%, by 2050. The m-MSR can achieve that goal alone, by producing green sustainable fuels for the smaller ships and powering the largest ships. Zero emissions come as standard. Advanced atomic technologies are like atomic battery packs. Small, with few moving parts, it can be a third cheaper to run than a large fossil fuelled engine. It massively reduces waste, and is fuelled-for-life, avoiding proliferation of spent fuel. Advanced atomic technologies can be inherently walk-away safe. Atomic reactors produce heat. Therefore, the coolant is the key to safety. This is the very definition of passive walk-away safety which will create a positive public opinion.
