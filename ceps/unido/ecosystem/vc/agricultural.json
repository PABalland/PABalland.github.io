Since the dawn of agriculture, human beings have continually sought higher efficiency and security in the production and trading of food. The modern age has seen the economics of agriculture and soft commodities repeatedly transformed by sudden technical innovations, a pattern which will continue to repeat itself. In the 1850’s advancements in refrigeration and food preservation dramatically lowered food prices and increased availability. In the 1940’s innovation came in the form of gasoline tractors replacing horse drawn plows. Today, blockchain technology is poised to play a major part in the agricultural revolution of our time.  GrainChain’s patent pending solution utilizes blockchain technology to address numerous issues present within the soft commodities markets, such as fraud at all stages, large and small-scale corruption, payment delays, access to futures commodities market, and a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape.  GrainChain changes this.  GrainChain utilizes the well-known properties of blockchains to address the systemic problems present in soft commodities markets, an industry in which the GrainChain team already has first hand experience in building software solutions.  The GrainChain system greatly increases transparency and accountability within the agriculture business by eliminating disparate and wasteful paper trails, greatly eliminating the opportunity for fraud and dramatically reducing time and costs. It ensures the prompt and secure execution of contracts between farmers and buyers, by both automatically facilitating payment to the farmer and making available the corresponding financial instrument for trading on commodities markets while verifying it is backed by only real assets in the system. This shortens a process that can currently take weeks down to a nearly instantaneous one. GrainChain benefits farmers, buyers, brokers, storage facilities, banks, suppliers of agricultural goods, governments, and ultimately every food consumer on earth; everyone that benefits from a more honest and efficient agricultural indust GrainChain was first introduced in 2013 by an inventor and entrepreneur Luis Macias.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"Computing; Calculating","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Scientific and technological services","country":"United States","region":"Texas","city":"Mcallen"},{"id":"Derit Seeds","value":39650466,"value2":1,"parent":"East Asia and Pacific","color":"#365a94","Industries":"Agriculture, Biotechnology, Farming","HeadquartersLocation":"Tianjin, Guangdong, China","FullDescription":"Tianjin Druite Company specializes in cucumber breeding research and promotion.

It has an established, rapidly growing plantation with the prospect of a sawmill and energy-forestry operations, which will deliver both attractive returns to investors and significant social and environmental benefits. About Us: History map-3The New Forests Company was founded in 2004 with the vision of creating a sustainable timber resource in East Africa amidst rampant deforestation. As one of the most fertile regions in the world, East Africa should be able to supply its own timber needs and even export rather than importing the majority. We are excited to be reversing the traditional tale of exporting raw materials and importing value added products in a way that creates regional social, economic and environmental benefits. We planted our first tree in Mubende, Uganda in 2004. Since then the Company has rapidly expanded with four greenfield plantations in Uganda (Namwasa, Kirinya and Luwunga) and Tanzania (Kilolo) as well as a 49- year concession to manage an established plantation in Rwanda (the buffer zone around Nyungwe National Park). The Company is passionate about growing African forestry and continues to plant trees to counteract massive and rapid deforestation (The World Bank estimates that Sub-Saharan Africa will deforest 1.3 million hectares per annum). The Company also complies with the best forestry, social and environmental practices, as audited annually to comply with the Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC™) certification. The Group has also begun commercialising its timber assets and now operates four pole treatment plants, producing both CCA and creosote treated transmission, telephone, fencing and building poles, three sawmills (construction lumber, wooden pallets, school desks etc.) and a number of charcoal kilns (providing efficient biomass energy as an alternative to the expensive Heavy Fuel Oil). NFC aims to be the premier Pan-African, vertically integrated, socially responsible, sustainable timber company sharing the value created with our shareholders, employees, customers and neighbouring communities.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"Mauritius","region":"Plaines Wilhems","city":"Ebène"},{"id":"Farmerline","value":15192000,"value2":1,"parent":"Sub Saharan Africa","color":"#D3D3D3","Industries":"Agriculture, AgTech, Farming, Social Entrepreneurship","HeadquartersLocation":"Kumasi, Ashanti, Ghana","FullDescription":"Farmerline is an AgriTech startup that provides information access, record-keeping services, and communication for farmers.

Hydroponic greenhouse agriculture can be a great asset, but its energy requirements are high. The ideal answer is a self-sufficient and sustainable greenhouse technology which eliminates the need for external energy sources.     Brite Solar is a nano-materials company that has developed a transparent solar glass technology based on Die Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) . The first target market is greenhouse solar glass, which enables the greenhouse to generate electricity needed for sustaining the internal environment. Using this solar glass, the greenhouse's carbon footprint is significantly reduced as its reliance on externally generated electricity is significantly reduced or eliminated. This is a great value proposition for the greenhouse operator since it reduces the operating cost for the greenhouse by 28% which is currently the cost attributed to energy.  Brite's technology is based on nano-materials which are ink-jet printed on to glass panels, eliminating the expensive and complex production facilities needed to produce traditional solar panels.
