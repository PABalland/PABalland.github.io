It is the only company globally working on technology enabling a gradual implementation of Hyperloop-inspired solutions as an upgrade for the railway industry. The company has developed a unique, patent-pending magrail technology, which allows modernizing existing conventional railway lines to a standard of passive magnetic railways, reaching speed of  300 kph (186 mph) on normal lines and 415 kph (258 mph) on HSR lines. The magrail system allows keeping the functionality of conventional railways on a modernized line (railway operators can depreciate their existing rolling stock). Magrail can be subsequently transformed into a vacuum system – hyperrail, reaching speed of 600 kph (373 mph) on normal lines and 1000 kph (621 mph) on HSR lines. The third generation is hyperloop – vacuum magnetic railways built within new transportation corridors for top speed of 1200 kph (746 mph), using subsystems tested in the first two generations. Capex for retrofitting railway infrastructure to a magrail standard are estimated to ca. EUR 6-8 million per km, which is comparable to the cost of building a new highway and up to 60-70% lower than the average cost of building a new HSR line in the EU. Energy costs will be lower by ca. 13% for the speed of 300 kph (186 mph) compared to HSR, whole for the speed of 415 kph (258 mph) magrail needs the same amount of energy than HSR currently for 300 kph (186 mph). The maintenance costs will be ca. 25% lower than for HSR, due to elimination of friction of mechanical elements at high speeds. The company was founded in 2017 and until mid-2019 it submitted 8 patent applications. In the first half of 2019 it secured an EUR 3.8 million grant in Poland and raised EUR 334 thousands during the first Polish equity crowdfunding campaign on a UK-based platform Seedrs.  Currently a Proof of Concept (PoC) is almost completed (ca. 50 m. long test track, which will be demonstrated in Q4.2019)., while at the turn of 2020 and 2021 a demonstration of the first full-scale prototype is planned.

This is summarized in their founding philosophy the \"BPC\" model: - Building expertise and quality - Placement and strategic location - Concept and capacity in engineering solutions In the introductory phase of a project they complete a capacity and efficiency study based on such parameters as work flow, capacity, equipment, consolidation, etc. The study analyzes how investment-related earnings affect the tenant's total costs both in terms of capacity and efficiency. This can lead to major savings in maintenance costs, create greater openness, tie up less capital, generate more efficient use of railway vehicles and repair services, particularly through greater flexibility and less transport between trains etc. Directly after the introductory phase Train Alliance offers long-term stable returns through the provision of efficient operations and management. As a lessor they are clearly concerned and willing to engage in investments and always offer the highest and most modern technical standards available in the industry. Train Alliance Sweden AB is unlike a traditional finance company and its business agenda is to work closely with its clients and tenants to meet the needs of flexible and long-term solutions. The tenant maintains the disposition of the engineering capacity, this is a crucial parameter allowing them to develop and adapt their premises and at the same time retain the flexibility that tenancy involves. By combining the demand for long-term business with effective financing and leasing arrangements, Train Alliance has created a valuable new market for the maintenance of rail-related properties. The method can also be applied to other industries - It is a business model called Fortness. In the Fortness model the operator determines the basic foundation of any project, takes in offers and implements construction. After completion, Fortness AB acquires the property and the operator is offered partial ownership. Owning a stake helps to create a sense of security, long-term oversight and indirect inspection protection through regulations under the Companies Act for minority owners and partnership protection on various levels. The tenant makes a profit, as they are able to ensure long-term stable rents by leasing on an operating basis. Over time this makes it possible to price their services without risking their margins. Oversight is maintained whilst investment is largely removed from the operator's balance sheet thus freeing up the scope for working capital. Fortness also provides the operator with the ability to make a profit on the property as the merger is concluded at a fair market value after the construction is finished.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"Sweden","region":"Skane Lan","city":"Malmö"},{"id":"Seminole Gulf Railway","value":9600000,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Freight Service, Railroad, Supply Chain Management","HeadquartersLocation":"Fort Myers, Florida, United States","FullDescription":"Seminole Gulf Railway is a short-line railroad company that offers freight train shipping, cold storage,supply chain services, and dinner train experiences.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Florida","city":"Fort Myers"},{"id":"Zeleros","value":9525494,"value2":1,"parent":"Europe and Central Asia","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Air Transportation, Manufacturing, Public Transportation, Renewable Energy, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"Valencia, Comunidad Valenciana, Spain","FullDescription":"Zeleros is a Spanish company that develops hyperloop, the one already considered as the fifth means of transport.

Wolf graphics consultants provide a wide range of services for demonstrative evidence purposes such as animations, 3-D scale models and large-format courtroom exhibits. Specifically, Wolf has developed a next-generation restraint system for mobile aircrew members of military helicopters. The restraint system addresses the need to intelligently and automatically adapt the restraint response to the level of aircraft dynamics, attenuates crash acceleration pulses, and allows crewmember freedom of movement when greater restraint is not necessary. Additionally, Wolf has developed a Weigh-in-Motion System to detect anomalously loaded vehicles (such as those carrying vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs).  The smart technology developed for WIMS accurately determines total vehicle weight as well as individual axle and wheel weights of passing vehicles.  But since many checkpoints have serpentine approach layouts that are designed for speed control, the WIMS must also measure the lateral weight shifts associated with turning vehicles, and compensate for those weight shifts analytically using vehicle dynamics calculations.  Other DoD projects include a Smart Flight Glove, a modular ATD (aka Test Dummy) with frangible bones, a next generation Troop Seat featuring energy attentuation and a robotic arm used to clean eddy current condenser tubes.

Once a vibrant community, it is now challenged with a vicious cycle of poverty, isolation, and disinvestment. In the mid-1800s’, Homewood was a destination for the most affluent citizens of Pittsburgh, especially with the advent of the Pennsylvania Railroad; the railroad offered a chance for wealthy residents to escape city living. By 1910, Homewood housed 30,000 residents and was considered a choice location. It was not until a shift in the demographics in the 1950s that Homewood became more racially and economically integrated. During this time, the city claimed land in the Lower Hill District for the Civic Arena which displaced roughly 8,000 residents, many of whom decided to relocate to Homewood. Because the majority of these residents could not buy homes, rental apartments popped up to fill the need (Rebuilding Together Pittsburgh, 2010). The racial balance was now such that blacks outnumbered whites, leading to the phenomenon known as, “white flight,” where upper and middle-class white citizens left Homewood.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Pennsylvania","city":"Pittsburgh"},{"id":"Micro Precision","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Machinery Manufacturing, Manufacturing, Mechanical Engineering","HeadquartersLocation":"South Windham, Connecticut, United States","FullDescription":"Micro Precision is a contractor that supplies parts and mechanical assemblies to the U.S. Department of Defense and other government agencies.

This is our story. In May 1872, a tall, 34 year-old, red-bearded lawyer stepped down from the stage-coach at the Plaza of Los Angeles. Corporate attorney John Bicknell had his sights on building a law practice. What greeted him at the stage was a humble little pueblo with dusty unpaved street, no industry and scant business. He saw a pueblo of narrow streets and alleys between decrepit adobe buildings roofed with \"brea\" from tar pits west of the city. Bicknell, who had summed up his philosophy this way when counseling a younger lawyer, \"The safe way is to select a business that you will be satisfied to follow and build up a business of your own.\" He began to follow his own advice. By the 1880s, he had attracted one of the region's most important clients, the Southern Pacific Railroad. It took time to select a quality partner. But in 1890, Bicknell, a Republican, teamed with Walter Trask, a Democratic litigator, thus launching the unbroken chain of partnership that today is Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Also launched was a set of unique firm attributes. Those included selecting only quality lawyers; balancing ideas across the political spectrum; and providing powerful resources in both transactional and litigation-related legal services. More than a century later, these attributes still define today's Gibson Dunn. In 1897 Judge James Gibson joined the firm, thus instituting another Gibson Dunn tradition – hiring lawyers who make an impact in their communities. In 1903, in a move that created the largest firm in Los Angeles, Bicknell, Trask and Gibson merged their practice with that of former Los Angeles City Attorney William Dunn and former Assistant City Attorney Albert Crutcher. Carried out at the behest of a client in order to create a \"full-service\" firm, the combination was called an \"experiment\" in the local press. It has worked ever since. Nearly 100 years later, the press recently dubbed the firm \"The Rescue Squad\" for its response and service to clients in legal need. Another article remarked that it remains easier to get into the CIA than to become a lawyer at Gibson Dunn. The firm grew as the region grew, into both Northern and Southern California, and both nationally and internationally. By the 1970s, Gibson Dunn had offices in London and Paris. Shortly thereafter, the firm took the bold step of launching its practice in the nation's capital and New York. Since 2000, the firm has further expanded in Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia. As John Bicknell might say, the firm has \"built up a business\", based on those attributes of quality, balance and impact and on an unrelenting mission of achieving success for clients – a mission shared today by approximately 1000 lawyers worldwide.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Legal services","country":"United States","region":"California","city":"Los Angeles"},{"id":"SNCF","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"Europe and Central Asia","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Automotive, Public Transportation, Railroad, Transportation, Travel","HeadquartersLocation":"Saint-denis-lès-rebais, Ile-de-France, France","FullDescription":"SNCF is a world leader in public transportation.

Prior to the Setting Up of the Airports of Thailand Public Company Limited On 17 December 1903, the Wrights Brothers succeeded in flying an engined aircraft which was the real beginning of flying in the world. As a result, various nations were quick to appreciate the future importance of flying. Eight years later, a Belgian pilot, Van den Born flew to Thailand, taking the “Orville Wright” to perform the first flight show from 2 – 8 February 1911 at Sa Pathum Horse Racing Course, now known as the Royal Bangkok Sports Club. Thailand displayed an active interest in having airplanes for self – protection and air transport. On 28 February 1911, Thailand sent three officers to train in France. They were Major Luang Sakdi Sanlayawut (Sunee Suwanprateep), Captain Luang Arwut Sikikorn (Long Sinsuk) and First Lieutenant Tip Ketuthat. The three officers attended a flying training course in France where flying was at an advances stage of development. Having completed their training, they also visited many places in Europe and returned to Thailand on 2 November 1913 with eight airplanes that the Thai government had ordered. The four Breguets and four Nieuports were the first batch of Thai aircraft. Fittingly, the three new pilots became the first group of pilots and were honored to be the forefathers of the Royal Thai Air Force. The Ministry of Defence transferred the aviation activities to be under the command of the Army Engineer Inspector General Department and then a temporary hangar was constructed in back of the Police Patrol School, Pathumwan. Today this is the location of the Police Department. Part of the Sa Pathum constructed in back of the Police Patrol School, Pathumwan. Today this is the location of the Police Department. Part of the Sa Pathum Horse Racing Course was Sa Pathum airfield, Thailand’s first airport. Don Mueang (International) Airport (IATA: DMK, ICAO: VTBD) (or also (Old) Bangkok International Airport) is an airport in Bangkok, Thailand. The airport was officially opened on March 27, 1914, although the field had been in use earlier. The main field before the opening of Don Mueang International Airport was the Sa Pathum airfield. On September 28, 2006 the airport was replaced by Suvarnabhumi Airport. The airport is now only in use for charter flights. Don Mueang was an important hub of Asia and the hub of Thai Airways International. Don Mueang served the most air traffic in Thailand. As of 2005 more than 80 airlines served the airport and over 38,000,000 passengers, 160,000 flights and 700,000 tons of cargo were handled at this airport per year. In 2005 it was the 18th busiest airport in the world and 2nd in Asia by passenger volume. Don Mueang is a joint-use facility with the Royal Thai Air Force's Don Mueang Royal Thai Air Force Base, being the home of the RTAF the 1st Air Division, consisting primarily of non-combat aircraft. Vibhavadi Rangsit Road is the main route linking the airport with downtown Bangkok. The Uttaraphimuk Elevated Tollway, running above Vibhavadi Rangsit, offers a more rapid option for getting into the city and connects to Bangkok's inner city expressway network. Besides travelling by road, there is train service connecting to Hua Lamphong station in the center of town. The railway station is across the highway and linked with the airport by walkway bridge. Within a month of transferring to Suvarnabhumi, several low-cost airlines asked to move back to Don Mueang.[1] Airports of Thailand resisted the move and the government's Department of Aviation rejected the plan.As Suvarnabhumi Airport is current operating at near capacity, the idea of re-opening Don Mueang International Airport for low-cost airlines is being considered to help ease the traffic at Suvarnabhumi Airport. In addition to its current use as a terminal for charter flights, military aircraft and civil aviation Don Mueang might become a hub for aircraft maintenance. There is a golf course located between the two runways. The course has no separation whatsoever from the runway, and people are only held back by a red light when airplanes land and cross the golf course. From the aerial/satellite pictures below one can see the greens and bunkers quite well.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"Thailand","region":"Krung Thep","city":"Bangkok"},{"id":"B&P Enterprises","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Construction, Railroad, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"Southaven, Mississippi, United States","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Mississippi","city":"Southaven"},{"id":"Walz Scale","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Manufacturing, Railroad, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"East Peoria, Illinois, United States","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Illinois","city":"East Peoria"},{"id":"Qant","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"Europe and Central Asia","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Management Consulting, Railroad, Supply Chain Management","HeadquartersLocation":"Birkerød, Hovedstaden, Denmark","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"Denmark","region":"Hovedstaden","city":"Birkerød"},{"id":"Mesta","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"Norway","Industries":"Construction, Railroad, Service Industry","HeadquartersLocation":"Oslo, Oslo, Norway","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"Norway","region":"Oslo","city":"Oslo"},{"id":"National Salvage & Service Corporation","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Construction, Recycling, Waste Management","HeadquartersLocation":"Bloomington, Indiana, United States","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Indiana","city":"Bloomington"},{"id":"Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"South Asia","color":"#CDA817","Industries":"Customer Service, Government, Railroad, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India","FullDescription":"Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation Limited (LMRC) is a state-owned entity that operates a Mass Rapid Transit System for the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.

Over the past six decades, the business that was founded in a basement has become a trusted provider of electrical services. Today, its work portfolio includes billions of dollars of installed electrical solutions. Ducci Electrical has developed and installed some of the most logistically, technically, and architecturally complex projects in the Northeast. Its projects include major healthcare facilities, railroad and bridge construction, casinos, data centers, power plants, high-end shopping malls, state-of-the-art laboratory and education facilities, highway illumination and integrated management systems, traffic signalization, green projects, and historic renovations. Humble Beginnings E. John Ducci served during World War 2 in the U.S. Army as a sergeant and electrician for the 925th HAM Ordnance Company. After the war, he founded the Ducci Electric Company on July 1, 1949, in the basement of his Torrington, Connecticut home. Later, the company grew out of the basement and into an adjacent storefront. In the beginning, the company, then known as the Ducci Electric Company, focused on local service work, appliance sales, and repairs. Ducci’s wife, Francis H. Ducci, managed the company’s finances for more than 35 years until the couple’s retirement. From Tragedy, Growth for Ducci Electrical In 1955, two hurricanes hit Connecticut, leading to a disastrous flood of the Naugatuck River. Water rushed through Torrington, destroying homes, businesses, roads, bridges, and local utilities. In the aftermath, Ducci Electrical Contractors was incorporated in 1956 and the business focused on larger electrical construction work. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Ducci Electrical worked as a small regional contractor primarily serving northwest Connecticut. The 1980s and 1990s brought with them extraordinary growth, as Ducci Electrical Contractors grew by taking on more technically demanding commercial, industrial, utility, and healthcare work, while expanding throughout Connecticut and into western Massachusetts and upstate New York. In the 21st century, Ducci Electrical has become an industry leader, named consistently by the Engineering News-Record as one of the top 75 electrical contractors in the nation.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Connecticut","city":"Farmington"},{"id":"BEE Logistics","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"East Asia and Pacific","color":"#365a94","Industries":"Consulting, Freight Service, Logistics, Transportation, Warehousing","HeadquartersLocation":"Ho Chi Minh City, NA - Vietnam, Vietnam","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Transport, packaging and storing","country":"Vietnam","region":"NA - Vietnam","city":"Ho Chi Minh City"},{"id":"Corrigan Moving Systems","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Railroad, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"Farmington Hills, Michigan, United States","FullDescription":"At Corrigan Moving Systems, we pride ourselves on craftsmanship, commitment to customers and the tireless pursuit of excellence.

All the companies nevertheless maintain their own company characteristics and are run autonomously in pursuing their respective business objectives. Ferrovie dello Stato SpA, while leaving the autonomous legal responsibilities of the companies in which it holds shares unchanged, mainly carries out company type activity which is typical of a holding company (management of the subsidiaries, share ownership, etc..), as well as industrial type work. Through a system of Central Directorates, the parent company also sets strategic approaches and ensures the orientation and the coordination of the industrial policies of the operational companies. Leader in passenger rail transport, with 88% market share, and freight, with 7%, the FS Italiane Group has about 74,200 employees, 8,000 trains running per day, more than 830 million passengers per year, and 50 million tonnes of goods per year. The railway network includes over 16,700 km of tracks, of which about 1,000 km are dedicated to high-speed services. The FS Italiane Group aims to become the enterprise system that implements integrated and sustainable mobility and logistics services by exploiting synergistic transport infrastructures, thus creating value in Italy and abroad. In 2016, the FS Italiane Group confirmed its excellent performance, achieved over the past years, by reaching impressive financial results and profits of €772 million, never before achieved by the company. On 1st December 2016, the CEO of the Gruppo Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Renato Mazzoncini was unanimously elected as President of the Union Internationale des Chemins de fer (UIC), the association which represents the railway sector at a global level. The election recognises the commitment of the group in developing the railway sector and the ability to best represent its interests. It also means an important milestone for the Italian system, which will have the chance to influence the creation of transport policies at a global level, in one of the most strategic industries for investment and in terms of the impact it has on people and a country's economy. The UIC will also be called upon to play the vital role of consultant and advisor for the large investment programmes which are currently under way, or are scheduled for the next few years around the world: from the TEN-T European corridors (passengers and freight) to China, the US, India and Russia. Another important stage in the renewal process has been the introduction of the new Busitalia Fast service, which was presented in April in Berlin on the occasion of the sector's international trade fair Bus2Bus 2017. It offers competitive transport services at a domestic and European level, with high levels of safety and innovation. Created with the aim of becoming the main European player in long-distance mobility by bus, the service runs daily service to 15 Italian regions and over 90 cities in Italy and Germany, with a fleet of 60 latest-generation buses. And then during 2017, the FS Italiane group's rail freight transport and logistics services changed radically with the launch of the Polo Mercitalia, a single, large hub that brings together the group companies that operate in this area (Mercitalia Logistics, Mercitalia Rail, Gruppo TX Logistik, Mercitalia Intermodal, Mercitalia Transport & Services, Mercitalia Shunting & Terminal, TerAlp and TLF). On 29 December 2017, Anas joined the FS Italiane Group, contributing to the establishment of the first integrated rail and road hub in Europe for serving residents and investing €108 billion over the next ten years. However, the FS Group doesn't just limit itself to national borders.

Luxton was founding owner and editor of the Winnipeg Free Press. From the day the first edition rolled off the presses in 1872, the Winnipeg Free Press has been an integral part of the city and province it serves. It is a position the newspaper is certain to maintain in the new millennium. Part of the for the Free Press’ success can be attributed to the fact that it is only two years younger than the province of Manitoba, which joined Confederation in 1870, and actually two years older than the City of Winnipeg, which was incorporated in 1874. the result is that the newspaper has been around as long as the community itself, faithfully recording the growth and development of a muddy Prairie settlement at the forks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers into one of Canada’s leading cities and the capital of a thriving province of more than one million people. Indeed, there is no other major newspaper in Canada that is so closely associated with the hopes, dreams and ambitions of its readers than the Free Press. Over the years, the newspaper has gained a reputation as the province's leading source of news, information and debate about local matters and ideas, as well as Manitoba’s voice on national and international issues. Sir Clifford Sifton – Western patriarch, federal cabinet minister, and owner of the Free Press at the turn of the century. It is a reputation that can be traced back to the original owner and editor of the Free Press, W.F. Luxton, and his partner John A. Kenny. Together, these men launched a newspaper that was to grow into a formidable journalistic and commercial force and serve as the linchpin for a national chain of newspapers stretching across much of the country. With a population of 1,467, the Winnipeg of 1872 was the largest of several budding communities in Manitoba at a time when the future was as wide open and bright as the blue Prairie sky. Yet its future was by no means assured. By late 1880, the recently incorporated City of Winnipeg found itself in a competition with the nearby communities of Selkirk and Emerson for the new railroad that was being built across the country. After some debate, Winnipeg was eventually selected as the site, forever assuring the community's place as the province's leading city and providing the Free Press with a source of readers that would help make it one of the most important newspapers in the country. By the turn of the century, Manitoba had become an important player on the national scene. The railroad had helped bring hundreds of thousands of settlers to the Prairies, making Winnipeg a boomtown and the most important city in the West. And as the city became more important in local and national affairs, so did the Free Press. In retrospect, it is clear that two developments at this time were crucial to the continued success of the Free Press and its eventual development as one of Canada’s great newspapers. One was the acquisition of the newspaper by Sir Clifford Sifton, a man who distinguished himself as a powerful cabinet minister in the government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and would be remembered as one of the patriarchs of Western Canada. The other was Sifton’s decision to hire John W. Dafoe as editor of the newspaper and E.H.. Macklin as its chief business manager. Together, these three men provided the Free Press with the journalistic and commercial leadership required to outlast its competitors and maintain its position as the largest selling newspaper in Manitoba. The Winnipeg Free Press building on Mountain Avenue was completed in 1991. Along with equipment representing the latest in newspaper technology. Other journalists also contributed to the growing reputation of the Free Press. Cora Hind, who joined the Free Press in 1901 as an agriculture writer, was one of the leading female journalists of her day. Legend has it that she could walk into a grain field in August and predict the size of the crop in the fall. Over the years, the Free Press has continued to build on the foundation laid down by Sifton, Dafoe and Macklin. As the city and province grew, so did the newspaper’s circulation. By the mid-1980s, the Free Press had outgrown its once–grand downtown quarters at 300 Carlton Street and began developing plans for construction of a $150–million plant on Mountain Avenue, in the city's northwestern corner. Completed in 1991, the new building and its equipment represented the latest in newspaper technology. The three state–of–the–art computerized presses are capable of world–class colour reproduction and can each print newspapers at a rate of 75,000 per hour. In December, 2001, a new era began for the Free Press. The newspaper, along with sister paper Brandon Sun, was bought from Thomson Newspapers by FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership, a company founded by Ronald Stern and Bob Silver, two businessmen with strong Winnipeg roots. Stern and Silver, both born and raised in the city, have been partners for 20 years in Western Glove Works and, for lesser amounts of time, in other businesses, including two large newsprint mills in Alberta and Ontario. Stern is also the former publisher of Vancouver Magazine. The purchase of the Free Press by Stern and Silver bucked the North American trend toward bigger media companies. With the purchase, FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership became the owner of the largest independent newspaper in Canada. The success of any newspaper depends on more than good journalism. Display and classified advertising are important ingredients in maintaining healthy circulation and a viable business. The evolution of television news, including 24–hour news stations such as Newsworld and CNN, and the steady advancement of direct-mail advertising, specialty publications and Internet online news services pose a serious challenge to newspapers at the beginning of the 21st century. The Free Press has risen to the challenge, redefining itself as a full-service marketing and communications company and focussing its energy on the things it does best: providing news and information to subscribers along with the marketing reach that comes with the ability to distribute newspapers to an average of 125,000 readers seven days a week, including over 162,000 on Saturday. This has meant redefining the role of the newspaper by creating new sections and overhauling existing ones to ensure the content is focussed on the interests of readers. It has also meant finding better ways to serve advertisers, mostly through the creation of specialty products and supplements tailored to meet the need of the customer. Today’s Free Press is very different from the one published by Luxton and Kenny more than a century ago. However, one thing remains the same: the Free Press’ commitment to quality journalism and its dedication to promoting the intellectual, social and economic growth of the community it serves.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"Canada","region":"Manitoba","city":"Winnipeg"},{"id":"Green Cargo","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"Europe and Central Asia","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Logistics, Railroad, Supply Chain Management","HeadquartersLocation":"Solna, Stockholms Lan, Sweden","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Advertising; business","country":"Sweden","region":"Stockholms Lan","city":"Solna"},{"id":"American Transportation Research Institute","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Freight Service, Non Profit, Railroad, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"Arlington, Virginia, United States","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Virginia","city":"Arlington"},{"id":"LMTS","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Freight Service, Railroad, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"Raleigh, North Carolina, United States","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"North Carolina","city":"Raleigh"},{"id":"Fast Rent A Car","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"Middle East and North Africa","color":"#8B4513","Industries":"Commercial, Railroad, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United Arab Emirates","region":"Dubai","city":"Dubai"},{"id":"Mckinney Trailer Rentals","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Railroad, Rental, Transportation","HeadquartersLocation":"Pico Rivera, California, United States","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"California","city":"Pico Rivera"},{"id":"Mervis","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Manufacturing, Precious Metals, Recycling, Transportation, Waste Management","HeadquartersLocation":"Danville, Illinois, United States","FullDescription":"Mervis Recycling is a regional leader in the recycling, brokerage, transportation, and management of iron and metals.

For decades his company, Red Adair Wild Well Control, has regularly been called to deal with major oil fires. Adair grew up poor. He worked in a drugstore and for the railroad. For twenty years, beginning in 1939, he worked for Myron Kinley where he learned how to put out oil well fires. Near the end of the Second World War, he searched for unexploded shells in Japan and disarmed them. In 1962, Adair's reputation as a fearless firefighter spread when he put out a fire in Algeria nicknamed the Devil's Cigarette Lighter. It had been burning for six months, fueled by 550 million cubic feet of gas a day. In 1984, Adair's specialists put out a major offshore rig fire near Rio de Janeiro. His firefighters were the first to board the Occidental Petroleum Company's Piper Alpha oil rig in the North Sea after it was destroyed by an explosion in 1988. They were among the first to put out the devastating oil fires in Kuwait, started by Saddam Hussein's Iraqi military forces at the end of Operation Desert Storm in 1991. Red Adair and his company inspired the 1968 action-adventure film about their exploits titled Hellfighters, which starred John Wayne as Adair.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"Advertising; business","country":"United States","region":"Texas","city":"Houston"},{"id":"KONUX","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"Europe and Central Asia","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Consulting, Information Technology","HeadquartersLocation":"München, Bayern, Germany","FullDescription":"","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"Germany","region":"Bayern","city":"München"},{"id":"Elcon Associates","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"North America","color":"#800020","Industries":"Lighting, Manufacturing, Railroad, Waste Management","HeadquartersLocation":"Beaverton, Oregon, United States","FullDescription":"Elcon provides electrical and power systems engineering design and construction management for light rail, streetcar, electric trolleybuses, heavy rail, people movers, monorail, and commuter rail transit systems.","IPqweryMostPopularPatentClass":"","IPqweryMostPopularTrademarkClass":"","country":"United States","region":"Oregon","city":"Beaverton"},{"id":"Transmashholding","value":0,"value2":1,"parent":"Europe and Central Asia","color":"#8cab79","Industries":"Machinery Manufacturing, Manufacturing, Railroad","HeadquartersLocation":"Moscow, Moscow City, Russian Federation","FullDescription":"TMH is a manufacturer of rolling stock for railways and urban transport.
