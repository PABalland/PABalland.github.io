# Deep learning     

## 1. Definition and Overview  
-Clear explanation of the concept  
-Historical context and development    
Deep Learning is a branch of Machine Learning that involves training Deep Neural Networks, composed of layers of nodes (or neurons). Each layer progressively transforms raw input data into more abstract representations, allowing the model to capture complex patterns and relationships. Unlike traditional Machine Learning algorithms, which often require hand-picking important variables, Deep Learning models can automatically learn patterns from large datasets through their layered architecture. Due to the complex transformations that occur across multiple layers, DL models are often viewed as "black boxes," making it challenging to understand the underlying decision-making process.   

## 2. Key Principles/longer desciption    
-Fundamental ideas and theories   
-Mathematical or logical foundations
