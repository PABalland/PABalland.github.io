### ERSA Keynote: [Cities in a Post-Corona World](https://ersa.eventsair.com/ersawebconference2020/plenary-sessions)  
Keynote at the [Annual Congress of the  European Regional Science Association (ERSA)](https://ersa.eventsair.com/ersawebconference2020/plenary-sessions) on 'Cities in a Post-Corona World'. Cities are a global magnet to talent, capital, and knowledge. The success of cities has been so spectacular that it has propelled a worrying spatial divide within almost every country. Cities are also the most resilient social systems that humans have ever created. They have dwarfed the longevity of countries and corporations, and have bounced back from pandemics, to natural disasters, to economic crises. Is this time different? Will the coronavirus crisis put a halt to the home-run of cities? Or will the societal transitions triggered by this crisis (particularly in the digital sector) be another leg to the success of cities in the 21st century? In this talk, Pierre-Alexandre Balland will build on research on complex systems and economic geography to offer an outlook for cities in a post-corona world (August 2020)
