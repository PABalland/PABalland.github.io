Methodology: AI Model Dataset Integration

Data Sources:
- Notable AI models dataset (epoch)
- HuggingFace top models dataset (top_hf_models.csv from testing dropbox)

Integration Process:
1. Standardization
   - Normalized organization names using predefined mapping
   - Unified domain categories (e.g., Language, Vision, Audio, Multimodal)
   - Standardized model naming conventions

2. Filtering Criteria
   - Retained only models from organizations that have page on AIW
   - Matched organizations present in both datasets
   - Removed entries with missing organization data

3. Data Harmonization
   - Merged key metrics: organization, domain, model name, creation date, engagement metrics (likes/downloads)
   - Preserved original model attributes while adding engagement metrics from HuggingFace

Output:
- Combined dataset integrating industry and open-source AI models
- Standardized format enabling comparative analysis


Methodology: Treemap & Scoring System

Data Processing & Scoring:
4. Model Engagement Metrics
   - Normalized likes and downloads per day
   - Time-weighted engagement scores
   - Combined score (50:50) and used min-max scaling 0-100

5. Scoring System
- For models with both likes and downloads: Equal weighting (50/50)
- For all other models from epoch technical metrics were used
- For models with only one metric: Used available metric
- Default score of 50 when no metrics available (later removed)

Technical metrics scoring included:
- Model parameters (log-scaled)
- Training compute (log-scaled)
- Citation counts
- Engagement metrics (likes and downloads)

Hierarchical structure of Treemap

Level 1: Organizations
Level 2: Category (Products/Models)
Level 3: Domain/Type
Level 4: Individual items
