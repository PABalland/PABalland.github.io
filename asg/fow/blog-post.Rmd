### We urgently need good jobs        

<font size="4">

Good jobs are the foundation of inclusive growth and resilient societies. At the individual level, having a good job is fundamental to provide the most basic human needs of food and shelter but also for social inclusion, self-esteem and more advanced levels of fulfillment. But good jobs are also the key to creating healthy and safe communities. At the level of our society, good jobs means that technological progress and economic growth are shared and no one is left behind. This is important as societies that grow too unequal eventually collapse [lot of uneq now]. The importance of creating good jobs is increasingly recognized governments but also by the private sector - seeing it as a way to create a clear competitive advantage.   

### What are good jobs?         
It is hard to disagree on the fact that we need good jobs. But what makes a job 'good'? There are many frameworks that attempt to measure the quality of jobs. Freedom, equity, security and human dignity are put forward by the International Labour Organization Decent Work Indicators. The UNECE quality of employment framework add specific indicators such as discrimination at work, work-life balance and job satisfaction. The OECD job quality framework focuses on economic elements and emphasizes three key areas of earnings quality, labour market security, and the quality of the working environment. These are all incredibly important elements and they should be jointly taken into account when assessing job quality and to guide policy actions.   

### The dual nature of good jobs   
We believe that a good job is the combination of two key elements. The first element of a good job is fundamentally about human development. It empowers workers and leads to human flourishing. As labor divides when societies grow - the narrow and specific tasks that are executed by individuals, the set of relationships they entail and the place where it takes workers should lift individuals. But a good job is not just about the individual, it is a about the system itself. A second key element lies therefore in the fact that a good job should contribute to societal goals such as sustainable development, health and global well-being. Although advertisement software engineering is might qualify for the first element, its net contribution to society is more debatable. One the other hand, contribution to societal challenges can feed-back into individual self-esteem and fulfillment. The famous encounter of President John F. Kennedy and a NASA janitor is the prime example. As JFK asked the janitor what he did for NASA, he replied, "Sir, Iâ€™m helping put a man on the moon". The space race of our generation is to a large extent a race against ourselves to achieve a green transition and carbon neutrality. The graph representation below represents key technologies of the twin transition, in blue digital technologies and in green environmental technologies. The jobs connecting digital technologies to serve the green agendas are definitely serving society at large.

### Who is leading the green transition?       
We argue that good job policy should go beyond regulation on working conditions but also take into account this more systemic and societal approach by stimulating the creation of jobs in key areas such as the green transition. As a matter of example and to illustrate this thinking the interactive below displays the creation of new green technologies (measured by international patents). What is clear is that Europe is leading - despite lagging behind the US and China in many other technological areas (digital in particular). Europe has maintained a fairly stable dominant position in the green transition since the early 2000. This is remarkable, in the sense that this stability happened despite the meteoric rise of China. In less than 20 years, China increased its production of green patents by almost 20x. The main loser in relative terms is the United States, from almost 30% to about 20% now. Japan is also on a declining trend since the 2008 financial crisis. The important point here is that looking at the societal level - technology policy and good jobs are intrinsically intertwined.

### Skills and tasks over jobs and career    
Now zooming back to the individual level we need to go beyond jobs and careers and focus on skills and tasks. Jobs are a collection of tasks that require specific skills. AI automate tasks that happen to require human skills while some tasks are outsourced abroad when proximity is not needed to perform it. This double disruption causes the boundaries of jobs to shift, their structure to change and sometimes to disappear all together if the all portfolio of task can be performed with a machine or an AI. Looking at what elements characterize jobs and how they connect is highly informative of the overall quality of jobs. Below we present the clustering of elements such as abilities, education, knowledge, skills, work activities, work styles and work values from O*NET data. The clustering indicates the elements that are frequently associated with each other (for instance complex problem solving and working conditions) into the same jobs. This elements and their connections represents the DNA of jobs. What is clear from this figure is the bimodal distribution of job elements, with the physical elements on one hand and the more mental/desk ones on the other hand. We observe the clear delineatiation of relationships, communication, cognitive skills, data analytics clusters, complex skills and appreciation cluster (recognition, achievement, working conditions, independence).

### The structure of jobs & elements complexity        
Another way to explore how elements connect together is with graph visualization. The interactive graph belows shows the relatedness (normalized co-occurences) level. We can observe again the very sharp divide between the left side (manual) and right (cognitive) side of the graph and explore the different clusters in detail. The color indicates the level of complexity of elements. More redish colors indicate high level of complexity, while bluer colors indicate less complexity. Complexity here uses a structural indicator from the field of economic complexity [CITE]. This structural indicator can be seen as an interesting proxy to think about the quality of jobs in a context of rapid tasks automation. Complex elements are the ones that are highly in demand but by many but hard to train humans and machines for.

<br />


### Complex elements are associated with better working conditions         
Complex skills are the future of AI-human work but what is interesting is that the cluster of complex skills forming with elements such as complex problem solving, judgement & decision making and deductive & inductive reasoning is strongly associated with the appreciation cluster that combines recognition, achievement, working conditions or independence.  Complex skills tend correlate with excellent working conditions because leverage is on the side of workers. Therefore, accelerating the development of complex skills and tasks is the only way to improve human-AI complementarity rather than substitution.

### Where are good jobs in Europe?    
Assuming one does a good job in measuring the quality of jobs, a maybe bigger question is good jobs for whom? Or where the good jobs are located. To produce the interactive map below we combine the previous data with the EU Labour Force Survey of the International Labor Organization at the regional (NUTS2) level. What is clear is that there are smaller than expected national border effects. In fact, it is hard to even distinguish national borders - leading to the idea that good job policy should also be a matter of higher level of governance (EU, US, China levels) together with the local level (urban areas and regions). Another striking result is the clear West/East divide, with jobs requiring complex elements concentrating in the West and less complex ones concentrating in the East. To a much lesser extent but also visible is a North/South divide. But maybe the most striking patterns of all is the extreme concentration of good jobs in the capital cities. This is true for all countries, but the pattern is even stronger in less developed countries.
